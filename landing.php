   <h4 class="jtitle">To eliminate rehashing and needless inconsistency in law.</h4>
          <hr>
   <p>The legal system runs on text. Nearly all legal text is a copy or rework of something already existing. Our current technologies fail to make these connections.  This creates needless work, cost, delay, risk and legal confusion.</p>

          <hr>
         <h4 class="jtitle">The simplest possible programming language</h4>   
<hr>
   <p>We have created a modular template system of text cards that relies on {expansion} of strings and [expansion] of cards.  Period.  People can program their relationships.  Lawyers can codify boilerplate.  Management can have a data picture of the enterprise's relationships, situation and activities.   Smart contracts can be both technical &ldquo;dry&rdquo; code (i.e. self-contained code snippets) and legal &ldquo;wet&rdquo; code.</p>

               <h4 class="jtitle">Legal boilerplate becomes self-actuating.<hr></h4>

               <p>Lawyers can focus on advocacy and counseling clients.  Citizens and business managers can get to yes quicker and know their situation better with an assurance of a stable legal base upon which to build.  Smart contracts can operate both technically and legally. </p>

          <p>Contract and legal text becomes cards of text, interoperating, in git, shared, forked, tested and improved.</p>
