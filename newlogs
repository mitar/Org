Outcome.3.Progress={P1.Handle} will have the right to continue with the {Research} and to progress any hits, {Confirmed Hits}, or derivatives, analogs, or modified versions of the foregoing, identified during the conduct of the {Research} under this Agreement to be treated in the same way as if such hits or {Confirmed Hits} arose from a {P1.Handle} internal research and development program;

Outcome.3.License=Effective upon notice by {P2.Handle} in writing that it will not elect to negotiate a {DPAc Agreement}, to the extent legally able, {P2.Handle} shall grant to {P1.Handle} a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, right and license, with a right to grant sublicenses to {P1.Handle} {Affiliates} and collaborators, under {P2.Handle}’s rights in any existing and/or arising intellectual property claiming the {Material};

Outcome.3.NotExpose={P1.Handle} will not have an obligation to provide to {P2.Handle} or to publish any structures of any of the {Confirmed Hits} from the {Research}; and

Outcome.4.Expose={P1.Handle} will not have an obligation to provide to {P2.Handle} or to publish any structures of any of the {Confirmed Hits} from the {Research};

Outcome.4.ProgressRefrain=if the {Research} generated any {Confirmed Hits}, {P1.Handle} will not, for a period of three (3) years following the Effective Date of this Agreement, conduct any activities using any such {Confirmed Hits} in connection with the specific target identified by {P2.Handle} in the {Material}s, unless {P1.Handle} exercises its rights pursuant to Section {Outcome.4.ProgressOption.Xnum} below;

Outcome.4.ProgressOption=if the {Research} generated any {Confirmed Hits}, {P1.Handle} may, for a period of three (3) years following the Effective Date of this Agreement, elect to continue the {Research} by providing written notice to {P2.Handle} and allowing {P2.Handle} the option to enter into a {DPAc Agreement} with {P1.Handle} for such purpose.
