<br>=This shows how the namespace of key/values (the "Dictionary" of a document) can be accessed.  In this hypothetical, I am considering the general list of bad chemicals for the Environmental provisions of the Master Services Agreement.  And I want the description of good chemicals for reference. 
<br>=
<br>=So instead of rendering the whole doc, I want to render only the relevant parts.  I also include a complete copy of the Environmental section in case of need.
<br>=
I attach the MSA:
Doc.=[core/form/agt/Master/Form]
<br>=
I then render just the parts I want, separately and then the whole section:
<br>=
Model.Root=<ol><li>Chemical.Good._Lost:<br>{Doc.Environment.Chemical.Good._Lost}<br><br></li><li>Chemical.Bad.A-Z:<br><b>{Doc.Environment.Chemical.Bad.A-Z}</b></li></ol><br><br><ol><li>{Doc.Environment._Sec}</li></ol>
