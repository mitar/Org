Ti=Cmacc from the Ground Up

1.sec=Cmacc can be used for things other than law, for instance in education and DIY.  Merger of text handling and programming.  Teaches a way to structure ideas and is an on-ramp to programming.  And this way, we can build a system that is very nearly totally open, because understandable to many, many. 

2.sec=Raspberry Pi is a great model for this.  So might be Python. 

3.sec=The grammar of of Cmacc has not been exhausted.  Indeed, perhaps we have only begun.  We should be very careful and should keep Cmacc as simple as possible.  But there are at least a few completions of the grammar that will increase its power and make it behave more consistently.  It would be great if we can find the superset of which Cmacc is a subset.  Schneier suggested Cmacc was a kind of Lisp.

4.sec=The O'Reilly <u>Raspberry Pi Cookbook</u> is great.  Reading section on learning Python.  Love the format.

5.0.sec=So perhaps we make:

5.1.sec=a manual for Cmacc

5.2.sec=a manual for CommonAccord (scripting legal consequences)

5.3.sec=a version of Cmacc designed to be DIY
