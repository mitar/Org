Ti=Cmacc from the Ground Up

1.sec=Cmacc can be used in education and DIY.  It is on the cusp between text handling and programming, enables structured ideas and is an on-ramp to programming.  It can be used to build a system that is very nearly totally open because directly understandable by many. 

2.sec=Raspberry Pi is a great model for this.  So to might be Python. 

3.sec=The grammar of of Cmacc has not been exhausted.  Indeed, perhaps we have only begun.  We should be very careful and should keep Cmacc as simple as possible.  But there are at least a few completions of the grammar that will increase its power and make it behave more consistently.  It would be great if we can find the superset of which Cmacc is a subset.  Schneier suggested Cmacc was a kind of Lisp.

4.sec=The O'Reilly <u>Raspberry Pi Cookbook</u> is a great model.

5.0.sec=So perhaps we make:

5.1.sec=a manual for Cmacc

5.2.sec=a manual for CommonAccord (scripting legal consequences)

5.3.sec=a version of Cmacc designed to be DIY
