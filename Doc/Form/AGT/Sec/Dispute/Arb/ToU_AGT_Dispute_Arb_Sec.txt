AGT.Dispute.Arb._Sec=PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES {YOU.HANDLE} TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH {YOU.HANDLE} CAN SEEK RELIEF.<p>{You and we} agree to arbitrate any dispute arising from these Terms or relating to the Site, except that {you and we} are not required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable or other relief for the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents. ARBITRATION PREVENTS {YOU OR WE} FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A JURY TRIAL.  {You and we} agree that {you and we} will notify each other of any dispute within thirty (30) days of when it arises, that {you and we} will attempt informal resolution prior to any demand for arbitration, that any arbitration will occur in {Arbitrator.Seat.City} and that arbitration will be conducted confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of {Arb.Org}.  {You and we} also agree that the state or federal courts in {Arbitrator.Court.County,State} have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals of an arbitration award and over any suit between the parties not subject to arbitration. In any arbitration, the parties will not seek discovery from each other, and the arbitrator shall not allow parties to engage in discovery; rather, each party shall disclose the evidence supporting their positions at some mutually agreeable time and date prior to the final hearing. Other than class procedures and remedies discussed below, the arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court. Neither {you nor we} will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by these Terms. {You and we} also agree not to participate in claims brought in an private attorney general or representative capacity, or consolidated claims involving another person, if {the other party} is a party to the proceeding. If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then that language shall be deemed to have been dropped from the Terms and the remaining obligations relating to arbitration shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
