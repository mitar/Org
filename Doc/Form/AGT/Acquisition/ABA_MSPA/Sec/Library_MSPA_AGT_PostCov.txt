PostCov.03.01.Intro=As used in this Section {7.3}, the term &ldquo;Confidential Information&rdquo; includes any of the following information held or used by or relating to any Acquired Company

PostCov.03.01.01._Sec=all information that is a Trade Secret

PostCov.03.01.02._Sec=all information concerning (i) product specifications, data, know-how, formulae, compositions, processes, designs, sketches, photographs, graphs, drawings, samples, inventions{q} and ideas, (ii) past, current{q} and planned research and development, (iii) current and planned manufacturing or distribution methods and processes{q} and (iv) computer hardware, computer software, database technologies, systems, structures{q} and architectures

PostCov.03.02._Sec=Each Seller acknowledges the confidential and proprietary nature of the Confidential Information and agrees that such Seller shall, except to the extent required for a Seller who is employed by an Acquired Company to fulfill his or her duties in the course of such employment, from and after the Closing:  (i) keep the Confidential Information confidential and deliver promptly to Buyer, or immediately destroy at Buyer&rsquo;s option, all embodiments and copies of the Confidential Information that are in such Seller&rsquo;s possession; (ii) not use the Confidential Information for any reason or purpose; and (iii) without limiting the foregoing, not disclose the Confidential Information to any Person, except with Buyer&rsquo;s Consent.

PostCov.03.03._Sec=Section {7.3(b)} does not apply to that part of the Confidential Information that becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a Breach of this Section {7.3} by any Seller.  Confidential Information shall not be deemed &ldquo;generally available to the public&rdquo; merely because it is included or incorporated in more general information that is publicly available or because it combines features which individually may be publicly available.

PostCov.03.04._Sec=If any Seller becomes compelled in any Proceeding to make any disclosure that is prohibited by this Section {7.3}, such Seller shall, to the extent legally permissible, provide Buyer with prompt notice of such compulsion so that Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the provisions of this Section {7.3}.  In the absence of a protective order or other remedy, such Seller may disclose that portion (and only that portion) of the Confidential Information that, based upon the opinion of such Seller&rsquo;s counsel, such Seller is legally compelled to disclose; provided, however, that such Seller shall use its best efforts to obtain written assurance that any Person to whom any Confidential Information is so disclosed shall accord confidential treatment to such Confidential Information.

PostCov.03.05._Sec=Nothing in this Section {7.3} will diminish the protections and benefits under applicable Legal Requirements to which any Trade Secret of any Acquired Company is entitled.  If any information that an Acquired Company asserts to be a Trade Secret under applicable Legal Requirements is found by a court of competent jurisdiction not to be such a Trade Secret, such information will nonetheless be considered Confidential Information of that Acquired Company for purposes of this Section {7.3}.

PostCov.04.Title=CUSTOMER AND OTHER BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS

PostCov.04.02._Sec=After the Closing, no Seller shall take any action, either directly or indirectly, that could diminish the value of any Acquired Company or interfere with the business of any Acquired Company.
