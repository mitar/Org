No Company financial obligation will arise without issuance of a PO.

Engage.Change._Sec=<u>Changes to a PO or SOW</u>.  Company may at any time, in writing, make reasonable changes in the work described in a PO or SOW.  If any changes cause an increase or decrease in the cost of, or the time required for the performance of, any work under a PO or SOW, an equitable adjustment shall be made in Supplier&rsquo;s fee or delivery schedule, or both.  Any Supplier claim for an adjustment must be asserted within ten (10) days of Supplier&rsquo;s receipt of the change notification, and must be approved in a written amendment (&ldquo;Change Order&rdquo;).

In the event that any Company Affiliate issues any PO or SOW pursuant to this Agreement, such PO or SOW:<ol><li>shall incorporate by reference the terms of this Agreement;</li><li>shall be deemed a separate contract between the parties who sign it; and</li><li>is an independent contractual obligation from any other PO or SOW.</li></ol>The term &ldquo;Company&rdquo; as used in this Agreement shall, for the purposes of any PO or SOW, issued by a Company Affiliate hereunder, be deemed to include only the Company Affiliate issuing such PO or SOW.

bStaff.Web.Register._Sec=<u>Web Registration</u>. The {CWD.Full} (the &ldquo;CWD&rdquo;) is a global, web-based application that houses basic information on all contingent workers providing services to Company.  Immediately upon receipt of a PO or SOW for Services under this Agreement and prior to the commencement of work for Company, Supplier shall initiate the registration process for the CWD by sending an email to {email.CWD.com} with &ldquo;New Supplier MSA&rdquo; in the subject line.  Thereafter, Supplier will receive instructions on registering to use and populating the CWD.  Supplier shall populate the CWD with the required information for all of Supplier&rsquo;s Personnel that are providing Services under this Agreement for more than ten (10) consecutive business days.  Supplier shall enter the required information for the applicable Supplier&rsquo;s Personnel prior to the start of each Supplier Personnel&rsquo;s assignment with the Company, and Supplier shall update the CWD to reflect the end of each Supplier Personnel&rsquo;s assignment as soon as such assignment ends.

Company will take appropriate measures to ensure that Personal Data relating to Supplier Personnel is stored securely and in conformity with applicable data protection laws. If any laws or regulations require that any of Supplier&rsquo;s Personnel whose Personal Data is entered into the CWD or other Company databases receive notice of or consent to such processing of his/her Personal Data, then Supplier:<ol><li>shall provide notice to and obtain consent from such Supplier&rsquo;s Personnel;</li><li>upon Company&rsquo;s request, shall provide Company with a copy of such notice and consent to Contingent Worker Database Administrator; {CWD.Addr.1,2}.</li></ol>By way of example only, an Example Personal Data Notice and Consent Form is attached hereto as {AGT.Exh.D}.

bComp.Base._Sec=Unless expressly modified in a PO or SOW:<ol><li>{bComp.Base.PerSchedule._Sec}</li><li>{bComp.Base.Currency._Sec}</li><li>{bComp.Base.Taxes._Sec}</li><li>{bComp.Base.Due._Sec}</li><li>{bComp.Base.EarlyDiscount._Sec}</li></ol>

bComp.Base.PerSchedule._Sec=Supplier shall be paid on a time and materials basis according to the Fee Schedule attached hereto as {AGT.Exh.A} or as provided in any applicable PO or SOW with expenses reimbursed in accordance with the {P1.Handle}

 Travel Policy attached hereto as {AGT.Exh.E}.  The foregoing will be the entire compensation to be paid to Supplier and will be in full discharge of any and all liability in contract or otherwise with respect to all Services rendered by the Supplier and Supplier Personnel.

If Supplier is obligated by law to charge any value added and/or similar tax to Company, Supplier shall ensure that if such value-added and/or similar tax is applicable, that it is invoiced to Company in accordance with applicable rules so as to allow Company to reclaim such value-added and/or similar tax from the appropriate government authority.  Neither party is responsible for taxes on the other party&rsquo;s income or the income of the other party&rsquo;s personnel or subcontractors.  If Company is required by government regulation to withhold taxes for which Supplier is responsible, Company will deduct such withholding tax from payment to Supplier and provide to Supplier a valid tax receipt in Supplier&rsquo;s name.  If Supplier is exempt from such withholding taxes as a result of a tax treaty or other regime, Supplier shall provide to Company a valid tax treaty residency certificate or other tax exemption certificate at a minimum of thirty (30) days prior to payment being due.

<b>Comp.Base.NB</b>=In the original, the .Due and >EarlyDiscount were one clause.  Made them two for clarity. 

bComp.Base.Timing._Sec={bComp.1.Due._Sec}  {bComp.1.EarlyDiscount._Sec}

bComp.Base.Due._Sec=All payment terms under this Agreement are net due one hundred and twenty (120) days from the Payment Start Date.  The Payment Start Date is the later of the required date identified on the applicable PO, the received date of the Services in Company&rsquo;s receiving system or the date of receipt of valid invoice by Company.  The received date of the Services in Company&rsquo;s receiving system will occur within forty eight (48) hours of Company receiving confirmation that the Services have been provided in accordance with the applicable PO or SOW.

bComp.Base.EarlyDiscount._Sec=Company shall be entitled to take an early payment discount of {EarlyPaymentDiscount.%} of the gross invoice price (&ldquo;Daily Discount Rate&rdquo;) for each day before one hundred and twenty (120) days from the Payment Start Date that payment is made.  For example, a discount of {EarlyPaymentDiscount.Example.1.%} would correspond to payment made {EarlyPaymentDiscount.Example.1.Days} early and a discount of {EarlyPaymentDiscount.Example.2.%} would correspond to payment made {EarlyPaymentDiscount.Example.2.Days} early.  The Daily Discount Rate has been calculated based on a Prime Rate (defined below) of {Base.Prime.Rate.%} (&ldquo;Base Prime Rate&rdquo;).  If the Prime Rate in effect on the last business day of any month exceeds the Base Prime Rate, the Daily Discount rate will be adjusted on such date by 0.0007% for every twenty five (25) basis points that the Prime Rate in effect on such date exceeds the Base Prime Rate; provided, however, that if the Prime Rate ever falls below the Base Prime Rate, then the Daily Base Discount Rate will remain {EarlyPaymentDiscount.%}.  If the Daily Base Discount Rate is adjusted on the last business day of the month as set forth above, then such adjusted Daily Base Discount Rate will be applicable to all invoices posted for payment during the following month.  For purposes of this Section, &ldquo;Prime Rate&rdquo; shall be the Prime Rate as published in the &ldquo;Money Rates&rdquo; section of The Wall Street Journal (or, in the event that such rate is not so published, as published in another nationally recognized publication) on the last business day of each month.  For example, if the Prime Rate exceeds the Base Prime Rate by 0.25%, on the last day of the month, the Daily Base Discount Rate for the following month will increase by 0.0007%.  Thus, a discount of {EarlyPaymentDiscount.Example.3.%} would correspond to payment made ten (10) days early (i.e., one hundred and ten (110) days from the Payment Start Date).  If the date Buyer uses to calculate the early payment discount falls on a weekend or a holiday, payment to Seller will be made on the next business day with the full discount taken as if the payment had been made to Seller on such weekend or holiday date.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Order, if Buyer elects to take the early payment discount to settle an invoice, Seller acknowledges and confirms that:<ol><li>title to the goods and services shall pass directly to {P1.FinanceWing.Name} ("{P1.FinanceWing.-}") in accordance with the terms of this Order;</li><li>once title to the goods and services has passed to {P1.FinanceWing.-}, {P1.FinanceWing.-} shall immediately and directly transfer such title to Buyer; and</li><li>any and all of the obligations, including representations and warranties Seller has provided with respect to the goods and services, shall be retained by Buyer, and Buyer may rely upon the same.</li></ol>Supplier&rsquo;s invoice shall in all cases bear Company&rsquo;s PO number and shall be issued no later than one hundred twenty (120) days after completion of the Services.  Company shall be entitled to reject Supplier&rsquo;s invoice if it fails to include the Company PO number, is issued after the date set forth above or is otherwise inaccurate, and any resulting delay in payment shall be Supplier&rsquo;s responsibility.  Supplier warrants that it is authorized to receive payment in the currency stated in this Agreement or any applicable PO or SOW.  No extra charges of any kind will be allowed unless specifically agreed in writing by Company.  Supplier warrants the pricing for any goods or services shall not exceed the pricing for the same or, comparable goods or services offered by Supplier to third parties.  Supplier shall promptly inform Company of any lower pricing levels for same or comparable goods or services, and the parties shall promptly make the appropriate price adjustment.

bComp.EndOfTerm._Sec=Upon termination as provided below, all fees shall be payable on a pro rated daily basis up to the date of termination and no installments shall be payable thereafter.

bComp.Unlawful._Sec=When any applicable governmental law, rule or regulation makes any payment prohibited or improper or requires the payment of a reduced fee, the portion of the fee so affected shall not be paid or if paid shall be refunded to Company.

bComp.SetOff._Sec=Company shall be entitled at all times to set off any amount owing at any time from Supplier to Company or its Affiliates in connection with this or any other agreement between Supplier and Company or its Affiliates.

bComp.bAudit._Sec=During the Term and for three (3) years thereafter, Supplier shall, at Company&rsquo;s request and without any additional charge, provide full and complete access during normal business hours to the offices, books and records of Supplier and its accountants for purposes of auditing any performance (including without limit employee screening and environmental compliance), compensation or reimbursement issue under this Agreement.
