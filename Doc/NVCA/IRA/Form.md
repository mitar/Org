[[ LOOKS LIKE THIS SHOULD BE A FOOTNOTE If this provision is included in the Agreement, careful attention should be paid to the denominator used in the calculation of the pro rata participation right.  Note that this language will not work if Section 4.1 has been set up to give the investors a preemptive right.  See footnote 41.]]   The closing of such sale shall occur within sixty (60) days of the date notice is given to the Major Investors.
