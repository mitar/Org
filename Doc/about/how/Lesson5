Since=we did such good work in [about/how/Lesson4] we will reference and build on it.


=[about/how/Lesson4]

AGT.Effective.YMD=September 4, 2014

Please=if you know programming, excuse the mismatch between the "YMD" and the format of Sept..2014.  There is NO SYNTAX except key/value!   The whole system is {key} expands into value.  (period!)

Prologue.Recital={P1} and {P2} wish to assure that {P2} will protect {P1}'s confidential information.
