Since=we did such good work in about/how/Lesson4 that we will now reference and build on it.


=[about/how/Lesson4]

AGT.Effective.YMD=September 4, 2014

Prologue.Recital=<span style="color:{fontmark2}">{P1.Handle} and {P2.Handle} wish to assure that {P2.Handle} will protect {P1.Handle}'s confidential information.</span>

fontmark2=magenta

Please=if you know programming, excuse the mismatch between the "YMD" and the format of Sept..2014.  There is NO SYNTAX except key/value!   The whole system is {key} expands into value.  (period!)
