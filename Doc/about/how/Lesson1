CommonAccord works by lists.=A sequence of labels with a text assigned to them. In software the label is called a "key" and the associated text is called a "value"  

Rendering always starts with the key "Model.Root".=  As if the text consisted only of {Model.Root} and then was "expanded".

Model.Root={hw}

hw={h} {w}

w=world

h=hello
