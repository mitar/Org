We=can now populate the agreement (or anything else). 

Here=is our frame and a couple of completions:

=[core/class/AGT_Frame]

AGT.Title=<font color="{fontmark1}">Non-Disclosure Agreement</font>

P1.Handle=<font color="{fontmark1}">Acme</font>

P2.Handle=<font color="{fontmark1}">Quake</font>

fontmark1=red

Note=the periods in the names are a convenient way to indicate that the something is a sub-category.  For programmers this looks very familiar.  If you are a programmer, please note that the period does not have any semantic meaning at all.  We use it a lot LIKE a semantic marker, but it is simply another character.  We could use x or / or q instead of a period.
