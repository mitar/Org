<p>=to finish up ... let's have the parties sign.


=[about/how/Lesson8]

P1.xSignature=x A Ang

P2.xSignature= x C Kendall

Sign.YMD=September 5, 2014

Note=these are like twitter handles.	

fontmark=black							

Treasure hunt=there is an additional trick in how "Sign.YMD" comes to fill for both P1 and P2.  See if you can find where the signature blocks come from!
