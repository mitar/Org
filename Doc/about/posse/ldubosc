Summary=Ludovic (@ldubosc), founder of Xwiki.com, an open source platform, did a remarkable implementation of CommonAccord in 2010.  Among other things, Ludovic was the first to implement recursion.  He created a remarkable view of the rendered page with coloring indicating the sources of the text, pop-up editing, and collapsable fields.  A video with those features can be seen at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL919EAgtME">youtube</a>, for instance.
