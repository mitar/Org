Bugs:

Get rid of the calls to outside http done in the framing of pages.  

I can't actually use the browser-based editing bz of privileges problem.  Work this out.



Features:

Get some of the rest of the team making documents.  Will show the strengths and weaknesses.

What links here?  Backlinks (happy to adopt other vocabulary).

Provide values for Missing fields (e.g., the missing field can be clicked, a text box opens, the user enters text, the text is saved as key=value at the top of the text.  Please also add a false missing field called "Comment" so the user can add comments when they want. 

In rendered view, mark text based on where it comes from.  

UI- Slide a different person (or other file) into a deal.  Take one out.
