Bugs:

At .Org:

There is no Up button when you are in a "list" view.  So if in /core/id/  you can't get to /core/  .  The Up button is visible in the show view.
(if you can eliminate the "Doc/" part of it, so much the better)

At the top of the tree of content /Doc we need the "list" view (to show the tree), instead of a homepage. We could have a very short intro here, but need to focus on the tree.  The homepage can be in Doc/about/

Need some side margins in the "list" and "render" view.  (Hard to read.)  Size of the text in "source" view is beautiful but too big, can't see very much of the document.  

Print and Save button on the top of the frame don't work.  "Save" at the bottom tries to save, but has a privileges errror. 
(at .Org this is not important - but should eliminate the buttons until we get them working). 



Love that you fixed the logo!
