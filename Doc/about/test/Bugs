Bugs:

In rough order of priority and apparent ease (your milage may vary):

"Try it" loops back to the homepage.

The Up function isn't there (see below)



There is no Up button when you are in a "list" view.  So if in /core/id/  you can't get to /core/  .  The Up button is visible in the show view.
(if you can eliminate the "Doc/" part of it, so much the better)

At the top of the tree of content /Doc we need the "list" view (to show the tree), instead of a homepage. We could have a very short intro here, but need to focus on the tree.  The homepage can be in Doc/about/

Print and Save button on the top of the frame don't work.  "Save" at the bottom tries to save, but has a privileges errror.  Turn it into a view raw button and forget about saving now.



Love that you fixed the logo!
