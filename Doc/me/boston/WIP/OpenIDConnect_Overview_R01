<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>The Office of Business Development is partnering with the MIT Media Lab and UMKC Law School to develop a prototype application which will allow for businesses to more seamlessly complete the online forms and applications associated with OBD services and programs such as Inquiries, ReStore and Business Technical Assistance.</p>

<p><strong>Easing Interaction with the City</strong></p>

<p>Businesses who interact with the City of Boston are required, across multiple agencies, to complete forms and applications that require basic personal information.</p>

<p>Completing these forms can be time consuming and when they are completed multiple times, across multiple agencies, there is the potential for inconsistencies in how forms are completed.</p>

<p><strong>The Solution:</strong></p>

<p>The &ldquo;Open ID Connect&rdquo; project aims to ease this pain point by building an &ldquo;Open ID&rdquo; architecture which will allow users to develop identity profiles which can be used, with the users permission, to provide basic personal information to applications, and avoid the need for repetitive data entry.</p>

<p>In addition to providing a better experience when completing forms and applications, the personal identity profiles which contain &ldquo;richer&rdquo; personal information which can be provided by the user to the City as desired to allow for a richer, more targeted delivery of services based on user profiles.</p>

<p>Forms targeted for this initial protoype include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Boston Business Hub Inquiry Form</li>
	<li>The ReStore Application</li>
	<li>The One-on-one Business Technical Assistance Application</li>
	<li>The Boston Buying Power Application</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of richer data that could be added to profiles includes;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Location</li>
	<li>Type of Business, Industry or Sector</li>
	<li>Gender</li>
	<li>Ethnicity</li>
	<li>Financial Data (Tax, Revenue)</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Assistance Needed&rdquo;</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Preferences&rdquo; or &ldquo;Interests&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Approach:</strong></p>

<p>The project will begin with a Prototype Jam, to be held at District Hall. The Prototype Jam will bring together an enthusiastic group of individuals who will hack or develop a solution which can then be tested and refined further.</p>

<p>The project will be completed in partnership with the UMKC Law School in Kansas City as well, and the open source application developed will be further tested and refined in both locations.</p>

<p><strong>The Outcome:</strong></p>

<p>We anticipate that we will have a working prototype to further develop. The prototype will allow user to create an online identify which will allow them to interact with the Boston Business Hub and populate rich data in existing forms and applications.</p>
