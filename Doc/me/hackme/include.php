This is the Company in a Box.  The Box is protective, defining. The Company lives in the Box, instead of just arriving in it.  So, the Box separates the inside of the Company from what is outside.  It has specific openings, so that traffic in and out is organized and can be controlled.  During the Code the Deal hackathon we implemented the Company and some outbound interfaces.  Inbound is the next step.  On reflection, after the hackathon, it seems better to put these interfaces in separate directories, inbound/ and outbound/.  TBD.
