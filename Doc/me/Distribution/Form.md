The {Initial_Stocking_Order}, excluding {Promotional_Units}, shall be credited towards the {Quarterly_Performance_Objective} for the first {Calendar_Quarter}.  {Product} purchases shall be counted for purposes of the {Quarterly_Performance_Objective} in the {Calendar_Quarter} in which {P1.the} delivers the {Product} to {Carrier} for shipment to  {P2.the}.  Returned or rejected {Products} shall be deducted from the dollar value for the {Calendar_Quarter} in which the credit for the returned or rejected {Product} to  {P2.the} was made. {P2.The} shall not be deemed to have failed to meet its {Quarterly_Performance_Objective} in a particular {Calendar_Quarter} if  {P2.the} submitted {Orders} to {P1.the} that meet or exceed its {Quarterly_Performance_Objective} and the cause of  {P2.the}’s failure to meet the {Quarterly_Performance_Objective} is {P1.the}’s failure to deliver the {Products} in accordance with its obligations under {Section 8} and {Section 9}.
