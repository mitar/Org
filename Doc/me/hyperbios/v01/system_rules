1.1.Title=Scope

1.1._sec=This Trust Framework applies to the use by {Co.Name} personnel of OpenID 2.0 and OpenID Connect as described in Section 3, collectively called {Co.Name}id. This Trust Framework also applies to all non-{Co.Name} users who connect to {Co.Name} systems using the {Co.Name} External Identity Federation.

1.1.Comment.1=Commentary: The scope defined in this draft text reflects the current language at https://id.mitre.org/about which reads “{Co.Name}id is an OpenID Identity Provider for {Co.Name} employees. Only current {Co.Name} employees have identities provisioned on this identity provider, and identities are not available for registration. This server is a research prototype service provided with best-effort system availability.”

1.1.Comment.2=Commentary: This section defines the scope and purposes of the federation. For example, if the underlying business scenario of the federation involved a multi-party consortia, such as the ID Federation, Inc (see idfederation.org), then the scope may be: “This identity federation system is provided for the purpose of enabling users of member organizations single-sign-on to designated applications and services of other member organizations.”

1.1.Comment.3=Commentary: A Business Use Case is a way to define the intended business scope of the {Co.Name} External Identity Federation and is a drafting technique that would be recommended if or when this research prototype matures into production grade operations. Business Use Cases describe the key supported interactions, including the transactions to be conducted, without detailed specification of technical details. While technical details are described in Technical Use Cases in Section 3, the nature of federated identity is such that some general reference to high-level technology may be referenced in the Business Use Cases. The Business Use Cases are intended to ensure alignment with the intended purposes of the federation and traceable continued achievement of the goals and objectives of the identity system. The Business Use Cases also provide a basis for establishing that the technology for opening up access to systems extends only so far as the owners of the underlying work intend and not necessarily as far as unbounded use of the technology can permit. More information on the Business Use Cases, in the context of the Legal and Technical Use Cases for federated identity systems, may be found at: www.civics.com/use-cases

1.1.Comment.4=Commentary: It is anticipated that the initial covered Business Use Cases will relate narrowly to 1) the use of OpenID 2.0 and OpenID Connect for access to the Handshake applications of the {Co.Name} Partnership Network and 2) use by {Co.Name} employees of {Co.Name} issued OpenID 2.0 and OpenID Connect Derived Federated Credentials to access external web sites. It is expected that one or two partners, such as JPL, Lincoln Labs, or the Advanced Cyber Security Center, will be identified to act as an initial partners to test usage of this approach, including use of OpenID 2.0 or OpenID Connect and agreement to the partner Participation Agreement. While Version 1.0 of these Rules are intended to cover a relatively conservative scope of Business Use Cases, the design of this approach intentionally scales to include additional Business Use Cases over time, and provides a process for the considered and deliberate choice to expand or otherwise change the scope as needed. It is anticipated that other potential scenarios could include: 1) many more partner organizations joining, and the requisite scaling requirements of more production grade systems for operations and shared services, 2) more types of applications and services available for access through use of federated identity under these rules, and the consequent updates to the types of business transactions in the use cases and additional legal reviews and updates as needed, as well as the more robust technical implementation required and consequent amendment to the types of standards, configurations, profiles and identity services offered, 3) usage of the {Co.Name} identity system and rules approach, with optional “modular” sections that would pertain when the framework is used to interoperate with a heavily regulated and complex system, such as the approach used by FHA to provide access to the Nationwide Health Information Network (NwHIN), which requires use of an authorized Gateway which is subject to the DURSA multilateral legal agreement; this modular approach could be accomplished in the business section by adding the purpose, scope and corresponding use cases, in the legal section by ensuring the additional requirements are met for that scenario, and in the technical section by adding additional attributes, other security services and components expected at the end-points at and behind the NwHIN Gateway, 4) the emergence of other partners usage of a Trust Framework System Rules governing their use of federated identity, as anticipated in the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace promotion of a new ecology of Trust Frameworks suitable for particular industries, economic sectors and other so-called “circles of trust”, and in this case the scope and use cases would include cross-certification and other methods for cross-boundary integration and harmonization of use cases through interstitial trans-federation agreements.

1.1.Comment.5=Commentary: Regarding potential scope in the longer term future: 1) In addition to collaborative systems of MPN, could also use a "modular" approach for adding adapters to interoperate with heavily regulated systems, for example the FHA approach to getting into NwHIN under DURSA (such that, for those interactions, a second layer of business, legal and tech rules and capabilities applied, and it would be possible with an attribute or other mechanism to delineate which end-point and other constraints were needed in those cases). In the case of a modular approach in the future, in effect, one or more attachments to the Trust Framework would service as contingent additional terms that further refine, modify and augment agreed base-line terms when the {Co.Name}id Trust Framework is used in particular and objectively defined contexts.

1.2.Title=Roles and Relationships

2.Comment.1=Commentary: The Roles and Relationships are core to the Trust Framework and System Rules, and require further conversation and feedback to adequately define. Below is an initial list of typical and relevant roles found within identify federations.

2.Comment.2=Commentary: If and when an external partner organization is recognized as a White Listed Identity Provider or Relying Party for its employees or other approved Users, an approach to this section might be to point toward a document listing the current participating white listed partners and for that document, directory, or repository to include the names of parties playing each role, as well as the relevant meta data and other technical information that may be available. This approach is modeled in Addendum 3.

1.3.0.1._Sen=Grey Listed sites include any Identity Provider or Relying Party that implements the standards in Section 3 and that has not been added to a White List or Black List by the System Operator. Any Grey Listed Relying Party may accept a Derived Federated Credential from any User and any User may use a Derived Federated Credential to access the site of any Grey Listed Relying Party.

1.3.0.2._Sen=If an Identity Provider is Grey Listed, then the Relying Party makes the decision on a per use or other basis whether to accept and rely upon credentials issued by that Identity Provider. If a Relying Party is on a Grey List then the User makes the decision whether to authorize the use of their Derived Federated Credential to access the Relying Party site.

1.3.2._Sec={st-}{1.3.2.Title}{-stb}{1.3.2._sec}

1.3.2.Title=White List

1.3.2._sec=The System Operator, by approval of or delegated authority by the Policy Authority, may add a Relying Party site to the {Co.Name}id White List, thereby allowing automated authorization for {Co.Name} Users.


1.3.3._Sec={st-}{1.3.3.Title}{-stb}{1.3.3._sec}

1.3.3.Title=Black List:

1.3.3._sec=The System Operator may determine whether a site is in violation of these rules or otherwise disapproved for federation, and upon such determination may add that site to the {Co.Name}id Black List, thereby preventing a {Co.Name} User from using their Derived Federated Credential to access such site and preventing Derived Federated Credentials from Black Listed Identity Providers from being used to access {Co.Name} Relying Party sites under this Trust Framework.


1.4._Sec={st-}{1.4.Title}{-stb}{1.4._sec}

1.5.Title=Business Processes and Practices

1.5._sec=The following business processes and practices apply to the use of {Co.Name} External Identity Federation (TBD).

1.5.Comment.1=Commentary: At this time, the actual practices and procedures to operate and use {Co.Name} External Identity Federation are largely ad hoc and tailored to the prototype scope of this initiative. However, eventually if and when use of {Co.Name} Identity Federation becomes a regular, operational production grade element of {Co.Name} systems, the recording of processes and practices applicable to key roles and parties will be important. It is typically best to note the details of these processes and practices in external documents, including guidance, FAQ and help files, which may be updated from time to time with little or no approval or notice, provided they do not violate any requirement or constraint in the System Rules or other applicable rules.

2.2.1._Sen=The authoritative current version of the Trust Framework System Rules can be found at www.mitre.org/trustframework ((note actual URL to be determined)). These Rules, including all documents explicitly Incorporated by Reference, provide standard default terms for use of the External Identity Federation, but in the event of a conflict between the terms of an existing contract between parties governing the terms of access to relevant applications or services, then the terms of the existing contract shall govern.

2.2.2._Sen=When the text of these Rules explicitly refers to a “document Incorporated by Reference” and includes a URL to the authoritative version of that document, then the content of that document shall have the same force and effect as if directly published within these Rules.

IN NO EVENT WILL THE {Co.Name} CORPORATION BE LIABLE FOR ANY GENERAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF {Co.Name} HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

2.3.2._Sen=ANY NON-{Co.Name} PARTY SUBJECT TO THIS TRUST FRAMEWORK AGREES TO INDEMNIFY AND HOLD HARMLESS {Co.Name}, ITS AFFILIATES AND SUBSIDIARIES, AND THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS OR TRUSTEES, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES AND AGENTS FROM ANY AND ALL INJURIES, LOSSES, CLAIMS AND DAMAGES TO ANY PERSON OR PROPERTY UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY AND IRRESPECTIVE OF THE CAUSE OF SAID LIABILITY, AND ALL COSTS AND EXPENSES INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ATTORNEYS' FEES AND ANY OTHER LIABILITIES INCURRED BY {Co.Name} AS A RESULT OF ANY NEGLIGENT OR WILLFUL ACTION OR OMISSION OF SUCH PARTY, HIS/HER EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS, OR ARISING OUT OF OR RESULTING IN ANY MANNER IN WHOLE OR IN PART FROM THE SUCH PARTY'S USE OF OR RELIANCE UPON {Co.Name}id OR {Co.Name} EXTERNAL IDENTITY FEDERATION OR ANY INFORMATION OR SERVICES COMPRISING OR RELATED TO {Co.Name}id OR {Co.Name} EXTERNAL IDENTITY FEDERATION.



2.4._Sec={st-}{2.4.Title}{-stb} {2.4._sec}

2.4.Title=Record Keeping and Reporting

2.4._sec=The required log files for Identity Providers and White Listed Relying Parties under Section 3.6 of this Trust Framework must be protected and maintained in accordance with reasonable commercial practices or as specified in any applicable certification or agreement. Such log files must be made available to {Co.Name} upon request when reasonably necessary to ensure {Co.Name} External Identity Federation system integrity or for purposes of troubleshooting {Co.Name} system issues.

2.4.Comment.1=Commentary: This section can, of course, be vastly more complex and prescriptive. However, given the current preliminary state of the {Co.Name}id prototype and the general interest in making interconnection a relatively easy matter, the requirements on third parties for administrative and other uncompensated duties have been greatly reduced. In addition, in the event of a White Listed or other trusted partner, it is possible that an additional agreement may specify higher level obligation regarding record keeping.

2.5._Sec={st-}{2.5.Title}{-stb} {2.5._sec}

2.5.Title=No Service Level Guarantee

2.5._sec=Reasonable efforts are made to maintain service, however you may notice occasional outages or disruptions as {Co.Name}id is being continuously refined. Under this Trust Framework, support of {Co.Name} External Identity Federation services as Identity Provider and/or Relying Party and/or otherwise may be modified or discontinued at any time and with no notice.

2.5.Comment.1=Commentary: This term may need to be modified within the Trust Framework to provide a notice period before discontinuation of the service if {Co.Name} intends for external parties to rely upon the service in the future. In addition, this term may need to be modified in the event {Co.Name} enters into a trusted partner agreement with entities on a White List and with whom more stable service levels are negotiated. In the event of such an additional White List or other trusted partner agreement, the additional service guaranties would supersede the terms of this Trust Framework under Section 2.8, defining Order of Precedence herein.

2.7.Title=Minimum Terms

2.7._sec=In the coding and implementation of {Co.Name}id services subject to this Trust Framework, Users should see the following terms ((TBD)):

2.7.Comment.1=Commentary: At this time, it is premature to include minimum mandatory terms. However, this section serves as a placeholder for the results of future discussion with {Co.Name} corporate counsel and other officials regarding required end-User terms, such as liability limitations, links to broader terms or privacy policy, notice of information sharing, consent to “remember” login authorization and similar terms.

2.9.Title=Applicable Law

2.9._sec=This Trust Framework will be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia without regard to Virginia conflicts of laws rules.

2.9.Comment.1=Commentary: Given that {Co.Name} Corporation is incorporated in Delaware, it is possible {Co.Name} legal counsel may seek Delaware or the law of another state to govern in this section. The reference to Virginia law reflects a clause on other {Co.Name} contracts and therefore is used as the starting point for this draft.

3.1.Comment.1=Commentary: For so long as {Co.Name}id is an early-stage research prototype, it is premature to focus on detailed documentation of supported use cases. However, this draft Trust Framework anticipates a future state at which external and internal parties will seek to implement and interoperate with {Co.Name} External Identity Federation services and the important role of this document to facilitate and regulate adoption. To that end, the types of technical use cases that would be relevant and constructive to detail in the future are noted below.
