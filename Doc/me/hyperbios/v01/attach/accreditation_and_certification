_Body=<h3>Potential {Co.Name}id Accreditation and Certification Approach</h3><p>Certification of federated identity services is a common method for both Identity Providers and Relying Parties to determine or help determine which other parties&rsquo; services to accept or rely upon. FICAM policies define certification of federated identity services for federal government use (see:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.idmanagement.gov/pages.cfm/page/ICAM" style="box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(65, 131, 196); text-decoration: none; background: transparent;">http://www.idmanagement.gov/pages.cfm/page/ICAM</a>) and the National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (aka NSTIC) has led to several federally funded pilots and an Identity Ecosystem Steering Group that are leading toward a national public sector and privacy sector approach to federated identity services certification (see:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.idecosystem.org/" style="box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(65, 131, 196); text-decoration: none; background: transparent;">http://www.idecosystem.org/</a>). In addition, it is expected that eventually, federal agencies will be required to accept externally issued identity credentials for login to agency websites and certification plays a key role in that initiative. At this time, however, given the {Co.Name}-enterprise centric scope and research prototype nature of the {Co.Name}id and {Co.Name} External Identity Federation services, it is premature to speculate on the appropriate role or weight to apply to certification. However, it is clear that certification is likely to be a constrictive and expected aspect of use or acceptance of identity federation in the future, and so at this time {Co.Name} is pursuing FICAM recognized certification of its OpenID 2.0 service via a Kantara accredited assessor and this draft Trust Framework System Rules document anticipates certification of external Identity Providers or Relying Parties as a factor in the White List decision by {Co.Name} System Operator.</p><p>Potential criteria when assessing certification for an external Identity Provider for use by {Co.Name} Relying Party sites might include:</p><p>&bull; External OpenID 2.0 servers should make available attributes with the same set of schema URLs and semantics</p><p>&bull; External OpenID 2.0 servers must comply with the OpenID 2.0 Authentication Protocol OpenID 2.0 (defined at<a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-authentication-2_0.html" style="box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(65, 131, 196); text-decoration: none; background: transparent;">http://openid.net/specs/openid-authentication-2_0.html</a>)</p><p>&bull; External OpenID Connect servers must support the final version of the OpenID Connect protocol as adopted by the working group</p><p>&bull; External OpenID Connect servers must support the Basic Client profile</p><p>&bull; External OpenID Connect servers should support at least the same set of claims noted in Section 3.2 of the Trust Framework System Rules.</p><p>Determination of which Certification Assessors may be sufficient to determine or recommend certification should follow further discussion and agreement about the potential role and weight certification will receive for purposes of {Co.Name} External Identity Federation.</p><p><span style="line-height:1.6em">&emsp;</span></p>
