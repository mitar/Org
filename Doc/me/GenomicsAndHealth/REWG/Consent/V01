1.Title=Introduction

1.1=We invite you to be part of the {Project.Name.Full}. This project collaborates with researchers from around the world in studies approved and monitored by {Project.REB.Name.Full}.  This project is guided by {Framework.URL}.

Framework.URL=[[GenomicsAndHealth/REWG/Framework/V01|the Framework for Responsible Sharing of Genomic and Health-Related Data]]

1.2=The {Project.Name.Full} will include some or all of the following: {1.2.List}

1.2.List=<ol><li>{1.2.1};</li><li>{1.2.2};</li><li>{1.2.3}; and</li><li>{1.2.4}.</ol>  
1.2.1=Data collected during the project
1.2.2=Some data from your medical file or other personal and health information
1.2.3=Your self-reported health related data
1.2.4=Data from your stored tissues


1.3=Any data that may identify you will be kept in what are called controlled-access databases. This means researchers must have permission from a review committee to use the data that you and other participants have provided (see section 8. How will you protect my privacy?).  Such approved data may be shared online with researchers around the world. The results of studying your data will also be presented at conferences and in scientific publications. You will NOT be identified. 

1.4=You can learn more information about the organization of this project and general results when they become available at: {Project.www.me.com}.      

1.5=This project has been reviewed by {Project.REB.Name.Full}

1.6=If you think you might want to participate in this project, please read the rest of this form and take as much time as you need to ask questions.  The decision about whether to participate is completely up to you. Your decision to participate in the study will NOT affect your medical care.  


2.Sec=<b>{2.Title}</b><br><br>{2.1}<br><br>{2.2}<br><br>{2.3}<br><br>

2.Title=What is the purpose of this research?

2.1=Genes are the basic “instruction book” for the cells that make up our bodies. All genes are made of DNA.  The DNA of a person is more than 99% the same as the DNA of any other person, but no two people have exactly 100% the same DNA except for identical twins. The complete set of DNA in your body, including all its genes, is called your genome.  Although our DNA is very similar to each other, your genomic data is entirely unique. Variations in the genome explain some of the physical differences between people, and partly explain why some develop diseases like cancer, diabetes, asthma, and depression, while others do not.  At present, it is generally not possible to predict which changes in DNA lead to disease or health.

2.2=We have also found important differences in DNA between population groups. Only by comparing your DNA and medical data with that of other people can we identify patterns and relationships in the genes, together with the environment, to help us better understand health and disease. Thus, the purpose of the {Project.Name.Full} is to {Project.Description}. 

2.3=This is research, and not medical care. You should see a physician for any health problems or medical questions you might have.

3.Sec=<b>{3.Title}</b><br><br>{3.1}<br><br>


3.Title=What will you ask me to do if I decide to participate?  

3.1=We will first ask you a few questions to determine whether you can participate.  If yes, we will need  {3.1.List}

3.1.List=<b>Select</b> {3.1.List } is e.g. {3.1.List.123 } <i>{3.1.List.123}</i> 

3.1.List.123=<ol><li>{3.1.1},</li><li>{3.1.2} and </li><li>{3.1.3}.</ol>

3.1.1=access to your medical record
3.1.2=ask you to complete some questionnaires about…
3.1.3=access to data from stored tissue where applicable



4.Sec=<b>{4.Title}</b><br><br>{4.1}<br><br>{4.2}<br><br>{4.3}<br><br>{4.4}<br><br>

4.Title=What will happen with the data I give you?  

4.1=Your data will be stored in controlled-access databases (i.e. a server/cloud provider) that meet international security and safety standards.  Your data will be used for international research and may be moved and stored in different countries. 

4.2=Over the next {Project.Duration.Expected}, researchers will: {4.2.List}

4.2.List=<ul><li>{4.2.1}; and</li><li>{4.2.2}.</ul>
4.2.1=analyse your genetic information using a process called 'sequencing'
4.2.2=study DNA variation

4.3=Your data will be shared with other researchers around the world and used in future biomedical research projects after ethics approval. These projects can take place in universities, hospitals, non-profit groups, companies, and/or government laboratories. All researchers must respect the laws and ethical guidelines for biomedical research.  

4.4=Your data will be kept for a period of {Project.PersonalData.Retained.Duration}. 


5.Sec=<b>{5.Title}</b><br><br>{5.1}<br><br>

5.Title=Will I be paid to participate?

5.1={5.1 } select:  {5.1.N } or {5.1.R }

5.1.N=You will <b>not</b> be reimbursed or paid. {5.1.2}
5.2.R=You will be reimbursed for any inconvenience such as travel time.  {5.1.2}

5.1.2=Some of the research done with the information stored in the databases may one day lead to the development of software, tests, drugs, or other commercial products. If this happens, you will not receive any of the profits.


6.Sec=<b>{6.Title}</b><br><br>{6.1}<br><br>

6.Title=Are there any benefits to participating in the project?

6.1=You will not benefit personally because research usually takes a long time to produce medically useful results. However, your participation may help others in the future.  

7.Sec=<b>{7.Title}</b><br><br>{7.1}<br><br>

7.Title=What are the risks of participating?

7.1=Much like fingerprints, it is possible to identify someone if certain data are put together. While we use very strict data security measures to protect your privacy, there is always a small risk that your data may lead to you being re-identified. As technology advances, there may be new ways of linking data back to you that we cannot foresee today. Like other medical information, this may one day affect your insurability or employment. 


8.Sec=<b>{8.Title}</b><br><br>{8.1}<br><br>{8.2}<br><br>{8.3}<br><br>

8.Title=How will you protect my privacy?  

8.1=Your data will be stored online, in controlled-access databases. Only approved researchers will have access. An independent committee will determine whether to grant researchers access to your data. Numerous safeguards are in place to keep your information confidential. In particular, {8.1.List}
8.1.List=<ul><li>{8.1.1};</li><li>{8.1.2};</li><li>{8.1.3}; and</li><li>{8.1.4}.</ul>
8.1.1=Personal identifiers will be removed (i.e. name, date of birth, etc.)
8.1.2=Your personal details will be kept separate
8.1.3=Your data will be coded
8.1.4=Stringent security measures will prevent unauthorized access or misuse

8.2=These safeguards make it difficult to know which personal information came from you or any other participant. However, we cannot guarantee that you will never be re-identified.

8.3=Researchers who wish to access the database will be required to apply to {Project.PersonalDataOfficer.Name.Full} who will examine their credentials and data security plan. They will also make sure the proposed research project is consistent with your consent. You will not be identified if findings from your data are presented at scientific conferences or appear in scientific publications. {Project.PersonalDataOfficer.Name.Full} will notify you immediately in the event of a problem with privacy.


9.Sec=<b>{9.Title}</b><br><br>{9.1}<br><br>{9.2}<br><br>

9.Title=Can I change my mind after I decide to participate?

9.1=You may choose whether or not you wish to take part in this study. You are also free to withdraw at any time from the project. If you withdraw, your data will no longer be used.  However, data that has already been used for research i.e. now part of a dataset or is already published cannot be destroyed or removed.   

9.2={9.2.1.PhoneEmail}  {9.2.Cont}

9.2.1.PhoneEmail=You can withdraw by telephone to {Project.Contact.Phone} or by email to {Project.Contact.Email}.   
9.2.1.Mail=You can withdraw by mail to {Project.Contact.N,A}.

10.Sec=<b>{10.Title}</b><br><br>{10.1}<br><br>{10.2}<br><br>

10.Title=How can I find out about the results of the research?  

10.1=It will probably take a long time to interpret the data accurately. You can check the project’s web site at {Project.www.me.com} to read about the project’s progress and to see if there are any general results.

10.2=<b>Include the local policy on return of individual health results/incidental findings and role of physician where applicable</b>

11.Sec=<b>{11.Title}</b><br><br>{11.1}<br><br>

11.Title=Re-contact

11.1=With  your  permission,  we  may re-contact  you  to  invite  you  to  update  your questionnaire, to provide  additional data, or to  be  involved  in  new  research projects by other researchers.

12.Sec=<b>{12.Title}</b><br><br>{12.1}<br><br>

12.Title=Who can I contact if I have questions or concerns?
