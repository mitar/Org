Sales documents will obviously vary a great deal from one business to another.  They will largely consist of a portfolio of many similar documents.  This is a strenght of CommonAccord, because the portfolio can be both flexible and computable. Here we focus on an essential document for many companies, a "master services agreement."  This document is a kind of common law of commercial relations.  We expect that a law "commons" will evolve from shared master service agreements. <a href='http://twitter.com/commonaccord'>@commonaccord</a>.
