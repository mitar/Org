The holders of the Preferred Stock shall have conversion rights as follows:<ol><li><u>Right to Convert</u>.&nbsp; Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance of such share at the office of the Corporation or any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock, into that number of fully-paid, nonassessable shares of Common Stock determined by dividing the Original Issue Price for the relevant series by the Conversion Price for such series.&nbsp; (The number of shares of Common Stock into which each share of Preferred Stock of a series may be converted is hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;<strong>Conversion Rate</strong>&rdquo; for each such series.)&nbsp; Upon any decrease or increase in the Conversion Price for any series of Preferred Stock, as described in this Section 3, the Conversion Rate for such series shall be appropriately increased or decreased.</li><li><u>Automatic Conversion</u>.&nbsp; Each share of Preferred Stock shall automatically be converted into fully-paid, non-assessable shares of Common Stock at the then effective Conversion Rate for such share (i)&nbsp;immediately prior to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten initial public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &ldquo;<strong>Securities Act</strong>&rdquo;), covering the offer and sale of the Corporation&rsquo;s Common Stock, or (ii)&nbsp;upon the receipt by the Corporation of a written request for such conversion from the holders of a majority of the Preferred Stock then outstanding (voting as a single class and on an as-converted basis), or, if later, the effective date for conversion specified in such requests (each of the events referred to in (i) and (ii) are referred to herein as an &ldquo;<strong>Automatic Conversion Event</strong>&rdquo;).</li><li><u>Mechanics of Conversion</u>.&nbsp; No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of Preferred Stock.&nbsp; In lieu of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then fair market value of a share of Common Stock as determined by the Board of Directors.&nbsp; For such purpose, all shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder of Preferred Stock shall be aggregated, and any resulting fractional share of Common Stock shall be paid in cash.&nbsp; Before any holder of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock, and to receive certificates therefor, he shall either (A)&nbsp;surrender the certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Preferred Stock or (B)&nbsp;notify the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and execute an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates, and shall give written notice to the Corporation at such office that he elects to convert the same; <em>provided, however,</em> that on the date of an Automatic Conversion Event, the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock shall be converted automatically without any further action by the holders of such shares and whether or not the certificates representing such shares are surrendered to the Corporation or its transfer agent; <em>provided further</em>, however, that the Corporation shall not be obligated to issue certificates evidencing the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such Automatic Conversion Event unless either the certificates evidencing such shares of Preferred Stock are delivered to the Corporation or its transfer agent as provided above, or the holder notifies the Corporation or its transfer agent that such certificates have been lost, stolen or destroyed and executes an agreement satisfactory to the Corporation to indemnify the Corporation from any loss incurred by it in connection with such certificates.&nbsp; On the date of the occurrence of an Automatic Conversion Event, each holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, notwithstanding that the certificates representing such shares of Preferred Stock shall not have been surrendered at the office of the Corporation, that notice from the Corporation shall not have been received by any holder of record of shares of Preferred Stock, or that the certificates evidencing such shares of Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to such holder.</li><li><u>Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Common Stock</u>.&nbsp; In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, by payment of a stock dividend or otherwise), into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Price of each series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased.&nbsp; In the event the outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Prices in effect immediately prior to such combination shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately increased.</li><li><u>Adjustments for Subdivisions or Combinations of Preferred Stock</u>.&nbsp; In the event the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock or a series of Preferred Stock shall be subdivided (by stock split, by payment of a stock dividend or otherwise), into a greater number of shares of Preferred Stock, the Original Issue Price and Liquidation Preference of the affected series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such subdivision shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such subdivision, be proportionately decreased.&nbsp; In the event the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock or a series of Preferred Stock shall be combined (by reclassification or otherwise) into a lesser number of shares of Preferred Stock, the Original Issue Price and Liquidation Preference of the affected series of Preferred Stock in effect immediately prior to such combination shall, concurrently with the effectiveness of such combination, be proportionately increased.</li><li><u>Adjustments for Reclassification, Exchange and Substitution</u>.&nbsp; Subject to Section 2&nbsp;above (&ldquo;<strong>Liquidation Rights</strong>&rdquo;), if the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of any other class or classes of stock, whether by capital reorganization, reclassification or otherwise (other than a subdivision or combination of shares provided for above), then, in any such event, in lieu of the number of shares of Common Stock which the holders would otherwise have been entitled to receive each holder of such Preferred Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such shares of Preferred Stock into a number of shares of such other class or classes of stock which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of such series of Preferred Stock immediately before that change would have been entitled to receive in such reorganization or reclassification, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein with respect to such other shares.</li><li><u>Certificate as to Adjustments</u>.&nbsp; Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 3, the Corporation at its expense shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and furnish to each holder of Preferred Stock a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based.&nbsp; The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like certificate setting forth (i)&nbsp;such adjustments and readjustments, (ii)&nbsp;the Conversion Price at the time in effect and (iii)&nbsp;the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would be received upon the conversion of Preferred Stock.</li><li><u>Notices of Record Date</u>.&nbsp; In the event that this Corporation shall propose at any time:<ol><li>to declare any Distribution upon its Common Stock, whether in cash, property, stock or other securities, whether or not a regular cash dividend and whether or not out of earnings or earned surplus;</li><li>to effect any reclassification or recapitalization of its Common Stock outstanding involving a change in the Common Stock; or</li><li>to voluntarily liquidate or dissolve or to enter into any transaction deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the corporation pursuant to Section 5.2(d);</li></ol>then, in connection with each such event, this Corporation shall send to the holders of the Preferred Stock at least 10 days&rsquo; prior written notice of the date on which a record shall be taken for such Distribution (and specifying the date on which the holders of Common Stock shall be entitled thereto and, if applicable, the amount and character of such Distribution) or for determining rights to vote in respect of the matters referred to in (ii) and (iii) above.<br>Such written notice shall be given by first class mail (or express courier), postage prepaid, addressed to the holders of Preferred Stock at the address for each such holder as shown on the books of the Corporation and shall be deemed given on the date such notice is mailed.<br>The notice provisions set forth in this section may be shortened or waived prospectively or retrospectively by the consent or vote of the holders of a majority of the Preferred Stock, voting as a single class and on an as-converted basis.</li><li><u>Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion</u>.&nbsp; The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Preferred Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares of the Preferred Stock, the Corporation will take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purpose.</li></ol></li><li><u>Voting</u><ol><li><u>Restricted Class Voting</u>.&nbsp; Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or as required by law, the holders of Preferred Stock and the holders of Common Stock shall vote together and not as separate classes.</li><li><u>No Series Voting</u>.&nbsp;

The holders of shares of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to vote on all matters on which the Common Stock shall be entitled to vote.&nbsp; Holders of Preferred Stock shall be entitled to notice of any stockholders&rsquo; meeting in accordance with the Bylaws of the Corporation.&nbsp; Fractional votes shall not, however, be permitted and any fractional voting rights resulting from the above formula (after aggregating all shares into which shares of Preferred Stock held by each holder could be converted), shall be disregarded.</li><li><span style="background-color:#DDA0DD">Select -- 4.4. = { Cap.AA.Vote.Bd.1 } or 4.4.= { _empty }&nbsp;</span> Election of Directors.
