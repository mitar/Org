Naming files, keys and other stuff:

Our convention is to use CamelCase for words that you run together.

Naming for Files:

Our convention to separate words by spaces. MyDog.=[Sandy.txt].
There are a couple of things that don't work in file names.  The apostrophe, the comma  and likely others unknown are a problem. Spaces?

Naming Keys:

Our convention is to separate words by periods (dots) MyDog.Color=Brown 

You can't use the opening or closing curly bracket ( { } )("brace") in a key name.  


Error Messages - you wish!
If you get nothing, it likely means either:

There is no key named "Model.Root" in your list or the lists it refers to in unprefixed form.  OR

Your list (or one it references (recursively)) references a file that doesn't exist. In current state, the parser just returns nothing.
