Naming files, keys and other stuff=Our convention is to use CamelCase for words that you run together.

Naming for Files=Our convention to separate words by spaces. MyDog.=[Test/Sandy.txt].
There are a couple of things that don't work in file names.  The apostrophe, the comma  and likely others unknown are a problem. Spaces?

Naming Keys=Our convention is to separate words by periods (dots) MyDog.Color=Brown 

Naming Keys Limits=You can't use the opening or closing curly bracket ( { } )("brace") in a key name.  

Error Messages=you wish!

If you get nothing=it likely means either:<br>There is no key named "Model.Root" in your list or the lists it refers to in unprefixed form.  <br>OR<br>Your list (or one it references (recursively)) references a file that doesn't exist. In current state, the parser just returns nothing.

You might say=This parsing (of this page) is well-deserved.
