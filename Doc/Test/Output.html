("Defendant") on the other hand, in order to resolve the above-captioned lawsuit and all "Claims," as defined below.  The Defendant and the Named Plaintiffs will collectively be referred to hereafter as the "Parties".  <br><br><br>This Settlement Agreement is made with respect to the following recitals:<br><ol type="A"><li>On November 1, 2013, Plaintiffs filed a Class Action Complaint and Jury Trial Demand against Defendant (the "Complaint"), which was amended on November 15, 2013, (the "Amended Complaint"). The Amended Complaint alleges a Rule 23 class claim asserting alleged violations of the federal WARN Act.  The Amended Complaint alleges that .... The Amended Complaint further alleges that a class should be certified consisting of the Plaintiffs and the other similarly situated .... The Amended Complaint alleges that Defendant is liable to the ... for the alleged WARN Act violations under a "single employer" theory of liability. The Amended Complaint further alleges that the proposed class meets the requirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.</li><li>In its Answer to the Amended Complaint, filed on January 8, 2014, Defendant denied liability, and asserted numerous defenses to the WARN Act litigation, including, but not limited to: 1) Defendant was not the class members' employer, and the requirements of "single employer" liability have not been met; and 2) the conduct alleged to violate the WARN Act falls within the "faltering company" and "unforeseeable business circumstances" exceptions to the WARN Act. Defendant continues to deny liability on all of these grounds.</li><li>Counsel for the Named Parties and Defendant disagree as to whether Defendant has any obligation or liability under the WARN Act with respect to the claims asserted in the Amended Complaint. </li><li>The Parties have engaged in written discovery and have taken numerous depositions relevant to the facts, claims and potential damages in this matter.  The Parties also filed cross motions for summary judgment and Plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification, which Defendant opposed.  Prior to oral argument on the pending summary judgment motions and class certification motion, the Parties engaged in settlement negotiations, attempting to avoid further costly litigation and the uncertainties and risks associated therewith.  As a result of these negotiations, the Parties have agreed to enter into this Settlement Agreement, which includes certification of a proposed Settlement Class.  </li><li>For purposes of this Settlement Agreement only, the Parties agree that the proposed Settlement Class (as defined below) satisfies the requirements of Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</li><li>The resolution of the Action will save the resources of the Parties and the Court and is in the Parties' best interests.</li><li>The Parties agree to the certification of the Action as a class action for settlement purposes only, consisting of all former employees of Defendant, and who do not file a valid and timely request to opt-out of the class (the "Settlement Class").  The Parties have agreed that the best evidence available in this case suggests that all the Settlement Class Members who satisfy the above definition are listed in Exhibit A hereto.</li><li>For purposes of this Settlement Agreement, the Parties agree that the Named Plaintiffs shall be named as Class Representatives and Elbert & Applebaum, LLP and Rogers and Reinhardt, LLP  shall be appointed Class Counsel. </li><li>Class Counsel asserts that the Named Plaintiffs, in retaining the undersigned counsel, have agreed to pay counsel legal fees equal to 33% of the recovery, plus costs. </li><li>The WARN Act, &sect; 29 U.S.C. 2014(a)(6) provides that attorney's fees may be awarded to the prevailing party in a WARN action.</li><li>The Named Plaintiffs support the settlement of the Action pursuant to the terms of this Settlement Agreement. </li><li>Class Counsel asserts that the fee sought herein, which is 33% of the Settlement Amount, minus the Service Payments, plus costs, is customary in actions under the WARN Act.  </li><li>Class Counsel asserts that but for the legal services they provided, they proposed Settlement Class would not have had any recovery on their claims under the WARN Act.  </li><li>Class Counsel asserts that they have expended considerable time in prosecuting the WARN Act claims of the proposed Settlement Class and the legal fees provided herein, equal to 33% of the Settlement Amount minus the Service Payments (defined below), plus costs, are fair and reasonable. </li><li>The Parties have agreed to fully and finally compromise, settle, and resolve any and all demands, claims, and causes of action, present and future, arising from the Amended Complain, as described below. </ol><br>NOW THEREFORE, as material considerations and inducements to the execution of this Settlement Agreement, and in consideration of the mutual promises and agreements set forth herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereby agree as follows:<br><br><ol><li>The Parties agree to certification of the Settlement Class, as defined above, for settlement purposes only.  The Parties have agreed that the best evidence available in this case suggests that all the Settlement Class Members who satisfy the above definition are listed on Exhibit A hereto.  The named Plaintiffs shall be named as Class Representatives and Elbert & Applebaum, LLP and Rogers and Reinhardt, LLP  shall be appointed Class Counsel.</li><li>Defendant agrees to pay into a Qualified Settlement Fund ("the QSF") to be established by Class Counsel a total sum of Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000) (the "Settlement Amount") in order to fully and finally resolve the Claims as defined in paragraph 5 below in their entirety.  Class Counsel shall act as the trustee ("Trustee") of the QSF and make all distributions therefrom in accordance with this Settlement Agreement, once approved by the Court.  The QSF shall be terminated on or before 300th day following the initial settlement distributions.  The Settlement Amount is inclusive of Class Counsel's fees and costs; interest; back wages; the Class Representative's service payments; any liability for taxes on the Settlement Amount or on or arising from the distributions made therefrom; and any other obligation or liability arising out of this Settlement.  Under no circumstances shall Defendant be required to pay any sums in addition to the Settlement Amount described herein for any purpose whatsoever.  The Parties agree to the following distributions from the QSF:  (a) the sum of $5,000 to each of the Class Representatives for their services rendered in this action (the "Service Payments") and (b) attorneys' fees to Class Counsel totaling $90,000, plus costs of litigation and administration not to exceed $45,000; (c) the balance to be divided among the proposed Settlement Class Members who do not opt-out of this settlement as follows: a gross settlement claim of approximately $2,000, before deductions per Class Member. .  The exact amount of the disbursement to each Class Member shall be finally determined and made after the QSF has determined and made all other necessary deductions and payments and the exact number of Class Members after opt-outs is know. </li><li>If the Court grants an order ("Final Approval Order") fully, finally, and unconditionally granting the Parties' motion for approval of their settlement and extinguishing claims against the Released Parties as specified in paragraph 3, and an order dismissing the Action with prejudice, and this Settlement Agreement has not been voided at the option of a Party in accordance with the terms of this Settlement Agreement, then the "Effective Date" shall be deemed to occur (A) thirty (30) days after the entry of the Final Approval Order, if no appeal is filed within that 30-day period, or (B) upon the final disposition of any appeal that has the effect of affirming the Final Approval Order in its entirety.  </li><li>The Parties agree that Exhibit A, attached hereto, represents the best information currently available to the Parties concerning the identities of the members of the proposed Settlement Class.  Exhibit A also contains the last known address for each individual listed thereon according to the materials produced during discovery. </li><li>Upon the Effective Date, except for the rights arising out of this Settlement Agreement, each member of the Settlement Class, for and on behalf of themselves, and their respective predecessors, successors, heirs, assigns, administrators, spouses, children and estates (collectively, the "Releasing Parties"), shall be deemed to fully, forever, irrevocably and unconditionally release, remise, and discharge Paldan Enterprises, Inc. and its past and current owners, officers, investors, attorneys, representatives and agents, all funds that it or they own(s) or manage(s), all person with any interest in any such funds, and ll of their respective predecessors, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Released Parties"), of and from any and all claims, demands, debts, liabilities, obligations, liens, actions, and causes of action, costs, expenses, attorney's fees and damages of whatever kind or nature, at law, in equity and otherwise, whether known or unknown, anticipated, suspected or disclosed, which the Releasing Parties ever had or may now have, from the beginning of the world to this date, against the Released Parties, relating in any way to any Class Member's work for the Defendant, whether based on federal or state statutory or common law or in equity, including but not limited to any such claims that were or could have been asserted in the Complaint or Amended Complaint, including but not limited to any and all claims based on the WARN Act, and including but not limited to any claims based on a "single employer" theory of WARN Act liability.  The claims released hereunder are referred to herein as the "Claims".  </li><li>Class Counsel and Defendant's counsel shall cooperate to cause a joint motion to be filed with the Court for an order approving this Settlement Agreement ("Settlement Motion") substantially in the form of the Proposed Order attached hereto as Exhibit C, and Class Counsel shall mail the Class Notice, once Court-approved, to all proposed Settlement Class Members, as well as a Court-approved notice to former employees of Defendant who, according to Defendant's records, meet all of the criteria for inclusion in the Settlement Class except that their employment terminated after February 1, 2013 ("Post-Class Terminees").  The notice to the Post-Class Terminees (the "Post-Class Terminee Notice") will inform them that: people whose employment terminated after February 1, 2013 are not entitled to payment under the Settlement; company records indicate that they were terminated after February 1, 2013, therefore they will not receive any payment under the settlement; and, if they believe that their employment ended, involuntarily and without cause, before February 1, 2013 and (1) they wish to be paid from the Settlement, they must notify Class Counsel no later than thirty (30) days from the mailing of the Post-Class Terminee Notice and provide evidence of their date of actual termination, or (2) they wish to be excluded from the Settlement, they must submit a valid and timely request for exclusion.  The Notice will also inform them that, if they fail to provide evidence of their actual termination date, they will lose the right to participate in the Settlement, and that if they do not submit a valid and timely request for exclusion, they will be bound by the Release set forth in paragraph 5 of this Settlement Agreement with respect to claims arising from a termination occurring on or between November 3, 2012 through February 1, 2013. Should a Post-Class Terminee prove to the satisfaction of Class Counsel that their termination date was incorrect in Defendant's records and that their employment was in fact terminated involuntarily and without cause on or between November 3, 2012 and February 1, 2013, the Settlement amounts for the Settlement Class Members will be adjusted to accommodate any such Post-Class Terminee's settlement claim, and the rights of such Post-Class Terminee shall be subject to the Release set forth in the preceding paragraph in the same manner and to the same extent as all other Settlement Class members. The Post-Class Terminees are listed on Exhibit B, attached hereto. Exhibit B contains the last known address for each Post-Class Terminee according to the materials produced during discovery. </li><li>The rights and obligations of any proposed member of the Settlement Class who elects to opt-out of the proposed settlement ("Opt-out") and does so on a valid and timely basis in accordance with the terms of the Court's preliminary approval order will be unaffected by this Settlement Agreement and such Opt-out will have the same rights and obligations as the Opt-out would have had if this litigation had never been filed and this Settlement Agreement had never been executed.  An Opt-out shall not have any rights against the Defendant by reason of this Settlement Agreement and this Settlement Agreement shall not be admissible and/or used in any fashion in any action by any Opt-out.  The portion of the Settlement Amount intended for an Opt-out will be re-distributed among the remaining Settlement Class Members.</li><li>Within ten business (10) days of the  Effective Date, Defendant shall cause to be wired, or shall deliver a check for, the Settlement Amount of $4,000,000 to the QSF according to such instructions that Elbert & Applebaum, LLP provides to Defendant's counsel.  The QSF shall then promptly distribute the Settlement Amount in accordance wiht the terms of the Final Approval Order.</li><li>Upon occurrence of the Effective Date, all Claims of all of the Releasing Parties shall be deemed settled, released and dismissed in their entirety, on the merits, with prejudice.</li><li>Upon the Effective Date, this Action shall be dismissed with prejudice, with each Party to bear their own costs and fees.  The Parties agree that the Court shall retain jurisdiction solely to enforce the terms and conditions of this Settlement Agreement.</li><li>All notices and disbursements to the proposed Settlement Class Members will be made by first class mail to their last known addresses as set forth on Exhibit A and B, unless otherwise instructed by the proposed Settlement Class member or updated in accordance with Paragraph 12.</li><li>If a distribution is returned to the QSF as undeliverable, Class Counsel will attempt to locate the Settlement Class Member whose address has changed using a national address database to which Class Counsel subscribes.  The Parties agree that any funds payable to Settlement Class Members who cannot be located by Class Counsel within one hundred eightty (180) days after final approval of this Settlement (i.e., "Residual Funds") shall first be applied by the QSF toward the settlement claim of any new settlement class member, who is presently unknow ot the Parties, and therefore not listed on Exhibit A or B, and who appears within one hundred eighty (180) days following final approval of this Settlement Agreement ("New Settlement Class Member").  Any New Settlement Class Member must be able to establish to Class Counsel's satisfaction that he or she falls within the definition of the Settlement Class as defined herein.  If Class Counsel make such determination in favor of the New Settlement Class Member, Class Counsel shall determine whether the New Settlement Class Member falls into Subclass A or Subclass B based on proof of their termination date.    Depending on the number of New Settlement Class Members and the amount of Residitual Funds, the QSF will pay any New Settlement Class Members (who does not opt-out) his or her net pro rata share of the Residial Funds.  This payment shall be in exchange for the New Settlement Class Member's acceptance of the terms of this Settlement Agreement and full settlement of all Claims and for the release of Clains appearing in Section 5, above, retroactive to the Effective Date, if the Effective Date has already occurred. Any Residual Funds not applied toward the claims of any New Settlement Class Members shall be paid by the QSF to the Impact Fund.</li><li>The Parties agree that they are compromising and settling disputed litigation.  Each of the Parties shall bear their own attorney's fees, expenses, and court costs.  Each of the Parties agrees that it shall not commence or continue any lawsuit that is inconsistent with any provision of this Settlement Agreement. </li><li>Nothing herein shall prevent any Party from seeking to offer this Settlement Agreement in evidence after the entry of the Order approving the Settlement Agreement by the Court for the purpose of enforcing the terms of the Settlement Agreement. </li><li>This Settlement Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the predecessors, heirs and assigns of each of the Parties to the fullest extent under the law.</li><li>This Settlement Agreement shall be construed pursuant to the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.</li><li>This Settlement Agreement and the Exhibits hereto represent the entire agreement and understanding between the Parties as to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all previous agreements and discussions between the Parties as to the matters herein addressed. This Settlement Agreement can be amended or modified only in writing and signed by or on behalf of all the Parties hereto, subject to any necessary Court or other approval.</li><li>This Settlement Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall constitute but one agreement.  This Settlement Agreement may be executed by facsimile or PDF and such facsimile or PDF signature shall be treated as an original signature hereunder.</li><li>This Settlement Agreement has been prepared by the joint efforts of the respective attorneys for each of the Parties. Each and every provision of this Settlement Agreement shall be construed as though each and every party hereto participated equally in the drafting hereof. As a result of the foregoing, any rule that the document is to be construed against the drafting party shall not be applicable.</li><li>Notwithstanding any other provision of this Settlement Agreement, all terms of this Settlement Agreement, including but not limited to Defendant's obligation to pay the Settlement Amount are contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective Date as set forth in paragraph 3 above.</li><li>The Parties may not waive any provision of this Settlement Agreement except by a written agreement signed by all of the Parties or their representatives.  A waiver of any provision of this Settlement Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any other provision.</li><li>This Settlement Agreement is intended to settle and dispose of claims which are contested and denied, and is being entered into to avoid the delay, uncertainty, inconvenience  and expense of protracted litigation of the disputed claims. Defendant expressly denies any wrongdoing and any violation of law as alleged in the Action. Nothing herein shall be construed as an admission by any Party of any liability of any kind to any other Party nor as a concession  as to the merits of any claim or any allegation by any Party. All Parties agree, and all Settlement Class members shall be deemed to have agreed, not to offer this Settlement Agreement as evidence or otherwise use it in any judicial or administrative proceeding, except that this Settlement Agreement may be introduced in any proceeding for the sole purpose of enforcing its terms.</li><li>Defendant stipulates, for settlement purposes only, to the certification of the Settlement Class, and does not waive, but instead expressly reserves, its right to challenge the propriety of class certification for any other purpose as if this Settlement Agreement had not been entered into in the event that the Effective Date does not occur. The Parties and Class Counsel agree that, if approved, certification of the Settlement Class is in no way an admission by Defendant that certification of a litigation class is proper in this action or in any other litigation against Defendant.  The Parties and Class Counsel further agree that, other than to effectuate the Settlement of this action in this jurisdiction, the certification of the Settlement Class for settlement purposes and all documents related thereto, including this Settlement Agreement and all accompanying exhibits and all orders entered by the Court in connection with this Settlement Agreement, shall not be admissible in any judicial, arbitral, administrative, investigative, or other court, tribunal, forum, or other proceeding, including without limitation any proceeding under the WARN Act, or any other litigation, against any of the Released Parties.</li><li>The Parties agree that if the Court does not approve any material term of this Settlement Agreement or requires as a condition to granting approval any term that effects a material change in this Settlement Agreement, then this Settlement Agreement may be voided at either Party's option, provided however that such right must be exercised no later than ten (10) days after any order granting final approval of the settlement. The Parties further agree that any requirement that Defendant pay any amount greater than the Settlement Amount specified in paragraph 2 shall be deemed a material change.</li><li>Within sixty (60) days after the Effective Date, Class Counsel shall take steps necessary to destroy or erase all documents and data produced by Defendant to Class Counsel in connection with this Action and which are currently in Class Counsel's possession, custody or control.  Class Counsel shall certify to Defendant, in writing, their good faith efforts to comply with their obligations under this provision. Class Counsel may treat this process of destruction/erasure as a case cost. Further, Class Counsel may and will keep their own work product and any of the Parties' filings that may refer to, quote, or incorporate documents and data.</li><li>If ten (10) or more members of the Settlement Class seek to be excluded from the Settlement, this Settlement Agreement shall be voidable at Defendant's option, provided that Defendant exercises this option no later than ten (10) business days following the deadline set forth in the preliminary approval order for potential class members to opt out of the Settlement Class. If Defendant exercises its option to void the Settlement Agreement pursuant to this paragraph, the Settlement Agreement shall be null and void and of no effect whatsoever. By signing this Settlement Agreement, the Named Plaintiffs agree that they will not seek to be excluded from the Parties' Settlement.  Conversely, if ten (10) or more Post-Class Terminees produce evidence that they do fall within the Settlement Class definition, and Defendant is unwilling to increase the Settlement Amount to satisfy the claims of said Post-Class Terminees (should they exceed nine (9) in proportion to the gross individual settlement amounts of the current Settlement Class Members, this Settlement Agreement shall be voidable at Plaintiffs' option, provided that Plaintiff exercises this option no later than ten (10) business days following the deadline set forth in the preliminary approval order for potential class members to opt out of the Settlement Class. If either Party exercises the option to void the Settlement Agreement pursuant to this paragraph, the Settlement Agreement shall be null and void and of no effect whatsoever.</li><li>The Named Plaintiffs each agree that they are entering into this Settlement Agreement knowingly, voluntarily, and with full knowledge of its significance. Each further affirms that they have not been coerced, threatened, or intimidated into signing this Settlement Agreement; that they have been advised to consult with an attorney; and that each of them in fact has consulted with an attorney before signing this Settlement Agreement. Class Counsel represent that they have conducted a thorough investigation into the facts of the Action and have diligently pursued an investigation of the claims asserted on behalf of the members of the Settlement Class against Defendant.  Based on their own independent investigation, analysis or information provided by Defendant and by third parties, including documents, depositions, and interviews, Class Counsel state that they are of the opinion that the settlement with Defendant is fair, reasonable, and adequate, and is in the best interest of the members of the Settlement Class, in light of all known facts and circumstances, including the risks of significant delay and defenses asserted by Defendant.</li><li>The Parties and their counsel agree not to disclose or publicize this settlement or its terms and conditions except as required by law to secure approval of or implement this settlement or as provided herein. To the extent that Class Counsel or Plaintiffs are approached by media for public statements, they may state, in substance, that this matter has been resolved pursuant to the terms of the publicly filed Settlement Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit any Party or counsel for any Party from responding with truthful information to any disparaging statement regarding the Parties or the settlement made in any print or electronic media outlet. Defendant also may respond to inquiries from media outlets regarding the settlement by stating, in substance, that it denies any liability in the action and settled the case in order to avoid the burden of continued litigation.  If Class Counsel desires to post a case description on their websites, it shall be limited to a short description of the claims asserted in the Action, and shall not express any views concerning Defendant's liability to the class or make any disparaging statements about the Defendant.</li><li>Any notices issued pursuant to the terms of this Settlement Agreement shall be sent to the Parties at the addresses of their respective counsel as set forth in the pleadings filed in Court in the Action.</ol><br></li><li><div><strong><center>THIS INSTRUMENT AND ANY SECURITIES ISSUABLE PURSUANT HERETO HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE &ldquo;ACT&rdquo;), OR UNDER THE SECURITIES LAWS OF CERTAIN STATES.
