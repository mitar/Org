Nothing here.  Incorporation is within scope, but not, at least so far, a priority.  For startups, there are a number of good solutions, including Clerky, Valcu, and LawPal.  Ultimately, you will want your incorporation to be part of your wallet, for management, communication with stakeholders and due diligence.  If this remains a painpoint for you or you have a better solution, let us know. @commonaccord.
