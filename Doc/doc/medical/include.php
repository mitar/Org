These show a medical record release request.  

The form is:

core/form/policy/health/privacyNYP_Patient_Authorization

In the first v01 we bring together parties.  Go there and look at the "Render" tab, then go to the bottom and you will see a list of "missing" fields.  To make the full document, we copy that list of missing fields and paste it in to v02.

In the second v02 we make a complete record. 

In the third v03, we take advantage of the structure to eliminate the unneeded MCUs (medical correspondence units) at the bottom of the document.

  Also did two privacy statements based on the NYP privacy brochure.  The automation includes HHS Office for Civil Rights (core/id/gov_hhs_ocr).  They are part of the graph and could be a source for more of the solution.
