These show a medical record release request.  

The form is:

core/form/policy/health/privacyNYP_Patient_Authorization

In the first v01 we bring together parties.  Go there and look at the "Render" tab, then go to the bottom and you will see a list of "missing" fields.  To make the full document, we copy that list of missing fields and paste it in to v02.

In the second v02 we make a complete record. 

In the third v03, we take advantage of the structure to eliminate the unneeded MCUs (medical correspondence units) at the bottom of the document.
