2.1.Sec=Cookies are unique identifiers that we transfer to your device to enable our systems to recognize your device and to provide features such as <a href="/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=468480">1-Click</a> purchasing, <a class="help-display-cond help-display-cond-hidden help-display-cond-rule-platform-DesktopBrowser" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/yourstore/nr/ref=hp_468496_recommended" target="_blank">Recommended for You</a> <span class="help-display-cond help-display-cond-hidden help-display-cond-rule-platform-MobileBrowser help-display-cond-rule-platform-MobileApp">Recommended for You</span>, personalized advertisements on other Web sites (e.g., Amazon Associates with content served by Amazon.com and Web sites using Checkout by Amazon payment service), and storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits. </span>

Additionally, you can disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the Web site of its manufacturer.

3.1.Ti=Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control

3.1.sec=We work closely with affiliated businesses. In some cases, such as Marketplace sellers, these businesses operate stores at Amazon.com or sell offerings to you at Amazon.com. In other cases, we operate stores, provide services, or sell product lines jointly with these businesses. <a href="#GUID-A2C397AB-68FE-4592-B4A2-7550D73EEFD2__SECTION_87C837F9CCD84769B4AE2BEB14AF4F01">Click here</a> for some examples of co-branded and joint offerings.

Also, in the unlikely event that Amazon.com, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. </span>

3.5.Ti=Protection of Amazon.com and Others

3.5.sec=We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?ie=UTF8&nodeId=508088" target="_blank">Conditions of Use</a> and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Amazon.com, our users, or others.
