1.Ti={Merchant_Services}

1.1.Ti={Merchant_Services}

1.1.sec=Users who intend to sell goods and/or services (each, a "{Merchant}") and who wish to accept bitcoin from purchasers as a method of payment may use a suite of tools and related services for this purpose (the "{Merchant_Services}"). Through the {Merchant_Services}, {P1_Handle} enables {Merchants} to accept bitcoin from customers as a method of payment, and processes the transfer of bitcoin to {Merchants} from their customers. {Merchants} may also sell bitcoin to, or buy bitcoin from, {P1_Handle}, and otherwise utilize the {P1_Services}, in the same manner as any other user. Use of {Merchant_Services} is subject to this Part 2 and is also subject to General Use terms, including without limitation the releases, indemnities, disclaimers, limitations of liability, prohibited use, dispute resolution, and cancellation policies set forth above.

1.2.Ti={Merchant} Profile

1.2.0.sec=Each {Merchant} user is required to provide accurate information necessary to complete a merchant profile associated with the user's {P1_Account}. This information may include business name, address and other contact information, website URL, taxpayer or other government ID, corporate documents, and other information {P1_Handle} may request. {P1_Handle} may limit {Merchant} transaction volumes depending on:

1.2.1.sec=the {Merchant}'s historical activity on {P1_Handle},

1.2.2.sec=satisfactory completion of a {Merchant} profile;

1.2.3.sec=satisfaction of reasonable requests for additional information;

2.Ti={Merchant} Transactions and Settlement

2.1.Ti=Transaction Confirmation

2.1.sec={P1_Handle} will provide users of {Merchant_Services} with an order notification indicating when or whether the {Merchant} has been paid by its customer.

2.1.1.Ti=Completed {Order} Notifications

2.1.1.sec=Upon {Merchant}'s customer's submission of a valid and accurate order through {Merchant_Services}, {P1_Handle} will immediately send a callback to {Merchant}'s designated callback URL to confirm successful transfer of the customer's payment to {Merchant} - so designated as a "completed" order. Except on suspicion of fraud, error, or abusive use, {P1_Handle} will not reverse a payment and/or corresponding bitcoin credit which it has designated as completed.

2.1.2.Ti=Timing of Completed {Order}

2.1.2.sec=If the {Merchant}'s customer uses a {P1_Handle} wallet to successfully initiate its purchase, {P1_Handle} will issue the completed callback order immediately to the {Merchant}. If the {Merchant}'s customer does not use a {P1_Handle} wallet to effect its purchase, {P1_Handle} will initiate an order status callback when {P1_Handle} detects that the {Merchant}'s customer has initiated a transaction which is broadcast through the {Bitcoin_network}.

2.1.3.Ti=Mispaid {Order} Notifications

2.1.3.sec=A callback may also indicate an order status as "mispaid," meaning {P1_Handle} has detected transfer of an amount of bitcoin not corresponding with the {Bitcoin_Price} and/or that the customer transferred bitcoin after expiration of a checkout window. "Mispaid" orders may result in transfer of bitcoin to {Merchant}'s {P1_Wallet} for further processing by {Merchant} in accordance with {Merchant}'s refund and order processing policies, but shall not be deemed completed by {P1_Handle}.

2.1.4.Ti=Limitations

2.1.4.sec={P1_Handle} may delay order verifications if {Merchant} has not provided its legal name, logo, website, phone number, address, taxpayer identification number, designation of business location and type. Until completion of such verification procedures, newly-boarded {Merchants} may experience delayed processing of {Bitcoin_Transactions} or {Conversion_Service} transactions. {P1_Handle} will designate any such delayed transaction as "pending," and funds will not be available in the {Merchant}'s {P1_Account} and/or Currency Account until the pending transaction is completed. {P1_Handle} reserves the right to refuse to process, cancel, or to reverse any {Merchant} transaction (<em>i</em>) as required by law, (<em>ii</em>) in response to a facially valid subpoena, court order, or other government order, or (<em>iii</em>) if {P1_Handle} reasonably suspects that the transaction is erroneous, or related to [Prohibited Use or Prohibited Business] (#toc_11) as defined in the {User_Agreement}.

2.1.=[02/Bit/Sec_04]

2.2.Ti=Instant Conversion

2.2.0.sec={P1_Handle} may offer its optional instant {Conversion_Service} (the "{Instant_Conversion_Service}," also referred to as "{Instant_Exchange}") to {Merchants} who have successfully linked a payout method to their {P1_Account}. The {Instant_Conversion_Service} will allow {Merchants} to designate the price of their goods and services in local currency (e.g., USD) and customers to pay for their purchases from such {Merchant} in bitcoin based on the Sell Price Conversion Rate quoted by {P1_Handle} on the {P1_Site} and displayed to the customer at the time that the customer approves the purchase. In connection with the {Instant_Conversion_Service}, the {Merchant}, as merchant of record for each transaction, shall:

2.2.1.sec=use {P1_Handle} to calculate an appropriate amount of bitcoin (a "{Bitcoin_Price}") to be transferred to {Merchant} as payment for a good or service with reference to the Sell Price Conversion Rate at the time {Merchant}'s customer visits the {Merchant}'s checkout page; {P1_Handle} will lock the {Bitcoin_Price} for a period of time, but if the customer does not initiate a transfer within a certain payment window, {P1_Handle} will recalculate the {Bitcoin_Price} based on an updated Sell Price Conversion Rate;

2.2.2.sec=accept bitcoin into its corresponding {Bitcoin_Wallet};

2.2.3.sec=immediately sell such bitcoin to {P1_Handle} using the {Instant_Conversion_Service}, and (<em>iv</em>) subsequently receive the proceeds from such bitcoin sale transaction from {P1_Handle} in the relevant local currency in an amount equal to the original USD price of the item, less applicable fees.

2.2.90.sec=By using this service, {P1_Handle} guarantees that regardless of any change in the price of bitcoin between the time of purchase and settlement, the {Merchant} will receive the fixed purchase price as designated by the {Merchant} in local currency at the time the customer approved the purchase, less applicable fees.

2.2.=[02/Bit/Ssec_03]

2.3.Ti=Settlement

2.3.sec=Settlements to {Merchant} in connection with the {Merchant}'s sale of bitcoin to {P1_Handle} will generally take a minimum of two to three business days, following {P1_Handle}'s transmission to {Merchant} of confirmation of the relevant transaction, although exceptions may apply.
