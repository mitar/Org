Ti={P1.Handle} {User_Agreement}

This {User_Agreement} (&quot;Agreement&quot;) is a contract between you (&quot;you,&quot; &quot;your&quot; or &quot;user&quot;) and {P1.N,E,A} (&quot;{P1.Handle},&quot; &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;) and applies to your use of the {P1.Handle} website and all services described herein (collectively, the &quot;{P1_Services}&quot;).

<em>Last updated: January 26, 2015</em>

Part 1: General Use

By signing up to use the {P1_Account} through the {P1.Handle} website located at {P1_com}, the {P1_API}, and/or any associated {P1.Handle}-hosted websites or mobile applications (collectively the &quot;{P1_Site}&quot;), you agree to comply with and be legally bound by {this_Agreement}, as revised from time to time. <strong>If you do not agree to any of the terms set forth in {this_Agreement}, or any subsequent modification to the Agreement, you may not access or use any of the {P1_Services} and must cancel your {P1_Account}, free of charge, in the manner set forth below. You further agree that any disputes between you and {P1.Handle} will be resolved by binding, individual arbitration and you waive your right to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration.

We may amend or modify {this_Agreement} by posting on the {P1_Site} or emailing to you the revised Agreement, and the revised Agreement shall be effective at such time. We may (a) modify or discontinue any portion of the {P1_Services}, and (b) suspend or terminate your access to the {P1_Services}, at any time, and from time to time, without notice to you in certain, limited circumstances described herein. You agree that we shall not be liable to you or any third party for any modification or termination of the {P1_Services}, or suspension or termination of your access to the {P1_Services}, except to the extent otherwise expressly set forth herein.

To be eligible to use the {P1_Services}, you must be at least 18 years old (or the applicable age of majority and contractual capacity). By accessing or using the {P1_Services} you represent and warrant that you are 18 or older.

Please note the following risks of using {P1_Services}:

<ul>
<li>Once submitted to the {Bitcoin_network}, a {Bitcoin_Transaction} (defined below) will be unconfirmed for a period of time (usually less than one hour, but up to one day or more) pending sufficient confirmation of the transaction by the {Bitcoin_network}. A transaction is not complete while it is in a pending state. Bitcoin associated with transactions that are in a pending state will be designated accordingly, and will not be included in your {P1_Account} balance or be available to conduct transactions.</li>
<li>The risk of loss in trading or holding bitcoin can be substantial. You should therefore carefully consider whether trading or holding bitcoin is suitable for you in light of your financial condition. In considering whether to trade or hold bitcoin, you should be aware that the price or value of bitcoin can change rapidly, decrease, and potentially even fall to zero. If you use a {P1.Handle} product which allows you and/or third parties to access and hold bitcoin private keys, you acknowledge that {P1.Handle} is not responsible for safeguarding such keys and that {P1.Handle} is not responsible for any loss of bitcoin resulting from theft, loss, or mishandling of bitcoin private keys outside its control.</li>
</ul>

1.Ti=Basic {P1_Services}

Your {P1.Handle} account (&quot;{P1_Account}&quot;) encompasses the following basic {P1_Services}, among others:

<ul>
<li>One or more hosted bitcoin wallets that allows users to store bitcoin private keys, and to track, transfer, and manage their bitcoin and account information and through which {P1.Handle} can facilitate {Bitcoin_Transactions} pursuant to instructions submitted by a user or authorized entity to {P1.Handle} (the &quot;Bitcoin Wallet&quot;);</li>
<li>A bitcoin conversion service through which users can buy bitcoin from, and sell bitcoin to, {P1.Handle} (the &quot;Conversion Service&quot;); and</li>
<li>For verified users, an account you can fund with U.S. Dollars for use in connection with the Conversion Service, the Exchange Service, and/or other services as {P1.Handle} may permit from time to time (a &quot;USD Wallet&quot;).</li>
</ul>

Each of these {P1_Services} is described in detail below.

2.Ti=Creating a {P1_Account}

2.1.Ti=Registration of {P1_Account}

.sec=In order to use any of the {P1_Services}, you must first register by providing your name, an e-mail address, password, and affirming your acceptance of {this_Agreement}. Upon successful completion of the registration process, {P1.Handle} will establish your {P1_Account}. {P1.Handle} may, in our sole discretion, refuse to allow you to establish a {P1_Account}, or limit the number of {P1_Accounts} that a single user may establish and maintain at any time.

2.2.Ti=Identity Verification

.sec=In order to use certain features of the {P1_Services}, including certain transfers of bitcoin and/or currency, you may be required to provide {P1.Handle} with certain personal information, including, but not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, date of birth, taxpayer identification number, government identification number, and information regarding your bank account (e.g., financial institution, account type, routing number, and account number). {P1.Handle} may also require you to answer certain questions or take actions in order to verify your identity, provide the {P1_Services} to you, or comply with applicable law. In submitting this or any other personal information as may be required, you verify that the information is accurate and authentic, and you agree to update {P1.Handle} if any information changes. <strong>You hereby authorize {P1.Handle} to, directly or through third parties make any inquiries we consider necessary to verify your identity and/or protect against fraud, including to query identity information contained in public reports (e.g., your name, address, past addresses, or date of birth), to query account information associated with your linked bank account (e.g., name or account balance), and to take action we reasonably deem necessary based on the results of such inquiries and reports. You further authorize any and all third parties to which such inquiries or requests may be directed to fully respond to such inquiries or requests.

3.Ti=Bitcoin Wallet

3.1.Ti=Sending and Receiving Bitcoin.</h3>

3.1.1.sec=As part of the services offered in connection with your {P1_Account}, {P1.Handle} can help you send bitcoin to, and request and receive bitcoin from, third parties pursuant to instructions you provide through the {P1_Site} (each such transaction is a &quot;{Bitcoin_Transaction}&quot;). You may initiate a {Bitcoin_Transaction} by going to the {P1_Site}, choosing to send or request, and entering the requisite information regarding the sender or recipient and the amount of bitcoin to be transferred. {P1.Handle} will then communicate with the {Bitcoin_network} on your behalf, as necessary, to facilitate each {Bitcoin_Transaction} in accordance with these instructions.

3.1.2. {P1.Handle} reserves the right to refuse to process or to cancel any pending {Bitcoin_Transaction} as required by law or in response to a subpoena, court order, or other binding government order. {P1.Handle} cannot reverse a {Bitcoin_Transaction} which has been communicated to and confirmed by the {Bitcoin_network}.

3.1.3.sec={P1.Handle} processes {Bitcoin_Transactions} according to the instructions received from its users and we do not guarantee the identity of any user, receiver, requestee or other party. You should verify all transaction information prior to submitting instructions to {P1.Handle} as the relevant {Bitcoin_Transaction} may not be cancelled or reversed once initiated.

3.1.4.sec=If you initiate a {Bitcoin_Transaction} by entering the recipient&#39;s bitcoin address, {P1.Handle} will confirm that the bitcoin address is valid; however, {P1.Handle} cannot confirm that the bitcoin address belongs to the intended recipient. In the event you initiate a {Bitcoin_Transaction} by entering the recipient&#39;s email address and the recipient does not have an existing {P1_Account}, {P1.Handle} will email the recipient and invite them to open a {P1_Account}. If the designated recipient does not open a {P1_Account} within 30 days, {P1.Handle} will return the bitcoin associated with the transaction to your {P1_Account}.

3.2 Bitcoin Storage &amp; Transmission Delays

.sec={P1.Handle} securely stores 100% of all bitcoin private keys in our control in a combination of online and offline storage. As a result, it may be necessary for {P1.Handle} to retrieve this information from offline storage in order to facilitate a {Bitcoin_Transaction} in accordance with your instructions, which may delay the initiation or crediting of such {Bitcoin_Transaction} for 48 hours or more. As a user of the {P1_Services}, you accept the risk that a {Bitcoin_Transaction} facilitated by {P1.Handle} may be delayed and you agree not to hold {P1.Handle} responsible for any damages or injury arising out of or related to such delay.

3.3. Your {Bitcoin_Transactions}.</h3>

3.3.1 Third Party Transactions

.sec={P1.Handle} has no control over, or liability for, the delivery, quality, safety, legality or any other aspect of any goods or services that you may purchase or sell to or from a third party (including other users of {P1_Services}). {P1.Handle} is not responsible for ensuring that a buyer or a seller you are dealing with will actually complete the transaction or is authorized to do so. If you experience a problem with any goods or services purchased from, or sold to, a third party in connection with bitcoin transferred using the {P1_Services}, or if you have a dispute with such third party, you must handle it directly with that third party. Due to the nature of bitcoin, any {Bitcoin_Transaction} conducted using the {P1_Services} is final regardless of any defects in or non-delivery of any goods or services purchased in connection with such {Bitcoin_Transaction}, or any other aspect of your transaction or relationship with the relevant third party. If you believe a third party has behaved in a fraudulent, misleading, or inappropriate manner, or if you cannot adequately resolve a dispute with a third party, you may notify {P1.Handle} Support at <a href="mailto:support@{P1_com}">support@{P1_com}</a> so that we may consider whether to take any action.

3.3.2. Refunds

.sec={P1.Handle} is not responsible for merchant refund policies. Certain merchants may wish to process a refund to you via a separate {Bitcoin_Transaction} having a value equal to the transaction amount being refunded, as expressed in local currency (e.g., U.S. dollars), based on the then current Conversion Rate. As a result, you may receive less (or more) bitcoin via a refund than you initially used to pay the {Merchant}.

3.3.3. Taxes

.sec=It is your sole responsibility to determine whether, and to what extent, any taxes apply to any transactions associated with your receipt or transfer of bitcoin, and/or to the {Bitcoin_Transactions} you conduct through the {P1_Services}, and to withhold, collect, report and remit the correct amounts of taxes to the appropriate tax authorities. Your transaction history is available through your {P1_Account}.

3.4 Limits

.sec={P1.Handle} reserves the right to change the buy/sell, transfer, trading, storage and velocity limits applicable to your Bitcoin Wallet in our sole discretion. We may require you to provide us with information about yourself and/or your {Bitcoin_Transactions} if your transactions exceed certain government reporting thresholds, such as thresholds regarding financial recordkeeping and tax reporting.

3.5. {P1_Vault}

.sec=You may elect to add heightened controls to your Bitcoin Wallet by transferring bitcoin to a special account designated for this purpose (the &quot;{P1_Vault}&quot;). The basic {P1_Vault} allows users to set time-delays which prohibit transfer of associated bitcoin within a designated period following a transfer instruction, and/or to require the electronic approval of multiple individuals designated by the user before transfers may be completed. Any bitcoin associated with the basic {P1_Vault} cannot be transferred until the time-delay period lapses or the requisite multi-party approval is obtained or both.

An advanced {P1_Vault} allows users the option to view, control, and distribute private keys of associated bitcoin to multiple third parties whose majority approval will be required to transfer associated bitcoin (the &quot;Multisig Vault&quot;). Although {P1.Handle} may, at the user&#39;s election, create encrypted backups of such private keys, these backups cannot be restored without a user-generated password. <strong>{P1.Handle} cannot restore encrypted private keys or otherwise recover private keys which are not within {P1.Handle}&#39;s control. Users of the Multisig Vault acknowledge that {P1.Handle} is not responsible for transferring, safeguarding, or maintaining private keys and bitcoin associated with a user&#39;s Multisig Vault.</strong> Only the user, with approval of requisite co-signers (if any), can transfer bitcoin associated with a Multisig Vault. If you and/or co-signing authorities lose, mishandle, or have stolen associated bitcoin private keys, or if your cosigners refuse to provide requisite authority, you acknowledge that you may not be able to recover associated bitcoin, and that {P1.Handle} is not responsible for such loss.

3.6. Customized {P1.Handle} Payment Page

.sec=You can use your {P1_Account} to establish a customizable payment page (&quot;Payment Page&quot;) which will allow others to easily send bitcoin to your Bitcoin Wallet. You may establish and customize your Payment Page through your {P1_Account} settings, which will allow you to establish a user handle and associated Payments Page URL, upload a photo, and provide a short description. In establishing your Payment Page and uploading or adding any text, photo, or other material, you agree that you will not (<em>i</em>) post misleading materials or misappropriate the identity of another person or entity, (<em>ii</em>) post any copyrighted material which you are not authorized to post, or (<em>iii</em>) post any profane, unlawful, or offensive materials. {P1.Handle}, in its sole discretion, may disable your Payment Page and take other action in accordance with {this_Agreement} if we believe you are in violation of the foregoing or abusing this service. {P1.Handle} may reclaim user handles associated with dormant {P1_Accounts}. {P1.Handle} does not guarantee or endorse the purported identity, message, or other information posted by a user to the user&#39;s Payment Page.

3.7 Advanced Protocols

.sec=We do not currently support metacoins, colored coins, or any advanced protocol which supplements the core Bitcoin Protocol. {P1.Handle} does not detect whether {Bitcoin_Transactions} associated with your {P1_Account} may involve any such protocol use. Do not use your {P1_Account} to effect any instruction or transfer involving an advanced protocol. {P1.Handle} is not responsible for any loss which may result from such use.

4. Conversion Service

4.1. Transactions with {P1.Handle}

.sec=When buying or selling bitcoin through the Conversion Service, you are buying from, or selling to, {P1.Handle} directly. {P1.Handle} does not act as an intermediary or marketplace between other buyers and sellers of bitcoin. The Conversion Service is subject to the {P1.Handle} &quot;Conversion Rate.&quot; &quot;Conversion Rate&quot; means the liquidity adjusted price of a given bitcoin amount in terms of local currency as quoted on the {P1_Site}. The Conversion Rate is stated either as a &quot;Buy Price,&quot; the price in terms of local currency at which you purchase bitcoin from {P1.Handle}, or as a &quot;Sell Price,&quot; the price in terms of local currency at which you sell bitcoin to {P1.Handle}. For the purpose of any transaction which incorporates the Conversion Rate, you agree, as a condition of using any {P1_Services}, to accept the Conversion Rate as the sole conversion metric.

4.2. Bitcoin Purchases

.sec=After successfully completing the verification steps described in the [Verification Procedures] (#toc_10) set forth below, you may purchase bitcoin from {P1.Handle}, subject to applicable daily limits. {P1.Handle} will instruct its bank to initiate a debit to your primary payment method or directly from your USD Wallet, or, if the payment is not successful, to any payment method you have on file, in an amount equal to: (a) the total number of bitcoin you wish to purchase multiplied by the Buy Price Conversion Rate quoted on the {P1_Site} at the time that you initiate the transaction, plus (b) the applicable Conversion Fee (defined below), plus (c) additional fees as may apply in the event that {P1.Handle} cannot draw funds from your payment method and must charge a backup payment method. When you initiate a purchase transaction, {P1.Handle} will provide a date by which your bitcoin will be made available in your Bitcoin Wallet, which may depend on the time required for {P1.Handle} to receive funds from your payment method. If your bitcoin purchase is marked as complete or pending in your Bitcoin Wallet, such transaction cannot be cancelled, reversed or changed. In connection with any purchase of bitcoin from {P1.Handle}, {P1.Handle} will use good faith efforts to fulfill such purchase order at the applicable Buy Price Conversion Rate quoted on the {P1_Site} at the time that you place such order. However, from time to time, it may be necessary for {P1.Handle} to delay fulfillment of a purchase order until such time as we are able to execute the transaction. In such cases, we will notify you through the {P1_Site} prior to the completion of your purchase order that the amount of bitcoin that you will receive will be determined based on the applicable Buy Price Conversion Rate quoted on the {P1_Site} at the subsequent point at which {P1.Handle}, with your further approval, may execute your transaction.

4.3. Sale Transactions

.sec=After successfully completing the verification steps described in the [Verification Procedures] (#toc_10), you may sell bitcoin to {P1.Handle}, subject to the above-referenced daily limits, by instructing {P1.Handle} accordingly. {P1.Handle} will then credit your USD Wallet directly, or instruct its bank to initiate a credit to your linked payout method, in an amount equal to: (a) the total number of bitcoin you wish to sell multiplied by the Sell Price Conversion Rate quoted on the {P1_Site} at the time that you initiate the transaction, minus (b) the applicable Conversion Fee (defined below). {P1.Handle} will then initiate a transfer of the appropriate amount of bitcoin from your Bitcoin Wallet to {P1.Handle}&#39;s own bitcoin wallet, and the related proceeds of funds will thereafter be credited to your linked payout method. The proceeds of any bitcoin sale will be credited to your linked payout method within two to three business days. Upon any sale of bitcoin to {P1.Handle}, all settlements or payments by {P1.Handle} for such transaction shall be paid in local currency (e.g., USD) at the applicable Sell Price Conversion Rate quoted on the {P1_Site} at the time that you approved the transaction.

4.4. Limits

.sec={P1.Handle} imposes limits on the number of bitcoin that you may buy, sell, or trade in a given day, as published in the [Verification Procedures] (#toc_10). {P1.Handle} reserves the right to change posted limits as we deem necessary or appropriate from time to time. {P1.Handle} does not guarantee the availability of its Conversion Service, and the act of purchasing bitcoin from {P1.Handle} does not result in a guarantee that you may sell your bitcoin to {P1.Handle}. If you wish to raise your limits beyond the highest-posted amounts, you may submit a request to <a href="mailto:support@{P1_com}">support@{P1_com}</a>. We may require you to submit additional information about yourself or your business, provide records, and arrange for meetings with {P1.Handle} staff (such process, &quot;{Enhanced_Due_Diligence}&quot;). {P1.Handle} reserves the right to charge you costs and fees associated with {Enhanced_Due_Diligence}, provided that we notify you in advance of any such charges accruing. In our sole discretion, we may refuse to raise your limits or we may lower your limits at a subsequent time even if you have completed {Enhanced_Due_Diligence}.

4.5. Conversion Fee

.sec=Each Conversion Service transaction is subject to a fee (the &quot;Conversion Fee&quot;, sometimes also referred to as an &quot;Exchange Fee&quot;) charged by {P1.Handle} which consists of: (a) a fee for the conversion of local currency (e.g., USD) for bitcoin (or vice versa) which is calculated as a percentage of the local currency to be converted, plus (b) a fixed transfer fee which may be applied to cover applicable bank fees. If you use your linked bank account to effect a conversion, the transfer fee is nominal—approximately $0.15—netted out of your settlement to or from {P1.Handle}. Payments using other methods, such as wire or credit card (if permitted), are subject to higher fees. {P1.Handle} will not process a conversion if the fixed transfer fee exceeds the value of your transaction. The fixed transfer fee does not apply to Conversions involving funds in your USD Wallet. The current Conversion Fee is displayed on the {P1_Site} prior to you completing a Conversion Service transaction. Your bank may charge you a non-sufficient funds (&quot;NSF&quot;) fee or overdraft fee in the event that you do not have sufficient funds to complete a transaction.

### 4.6. Payments.

4.6.1.sec=You agree to deliver payment for any bitcoin purchase made through the Conversion Service upon confirmation of an order, regardless of changes in the applicable Buy Price Conversion Rate prior to completion of the purchase transaction, with such payment to be made in good funds in the amount calculated in the manner specified herein.

4.6.2.sec=If there are insufficient funds from your linked primary payment method to cover the purchase price of any bitcoin order or any other amounts owed by you to us hereunder, you hereby authorize us to debit any of your payment methods which have been linked to your {P1_Account} for the full or partial amount of your purchase and any other amounts owed by you to us hereunder. We may resubmit debits or charges to your payment methods until all amounts owed by you to us hereunder are satisfied in full. You are responsible for maintaining an adequate balance in each of your accounts and sufficient credit limits on your credit cards in order to avoid any overdraft, NSF or similar fees. To secure the performance of your obligations under {this_Agreement}, you grant to {P1.Handle} a security interest in any and all of your funds or other property which come into the possession of {P1.Handle} and the bitcoin associated with your {P1_Account}. You will execute, deliver, and pay the fees for any documents we request to create, perfect, maintain and enforce this security interest.

4.6.3.sec=We may deduct any bitcoin held by you in a Bitcoin Wallet if a payment for a purchase of bitcoin using a bank account or credit card is subsequently reversed, for example, if such a payment is subject to a chargeback, reversal, claim or is otherwise invalidated. We may also deduct bitcoin held by you in a Bitcoin Wallet in satisfaction of any outstanding amount owed by you to {P1.Handle} under {this_Agreement}.

4.6.4.sec={P1.Handle} reserves the right to refuse to process, or to cancel or reverse, any purchases or sales of bitcoin in its sole discretion, including but not limited to instances where {P1.Handle} suspects the transaction involves (or has a high risk of involvement in) money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, or any other type of financial crime, in response to a subpoena, court order, or other government order, or if {P1.Handle} suspects the transaction relates to Prohibited Use or a Prohibited Business as set forth below.

5. USD Wallet

5.1. USD Wallets

.sec=Users who have verified their Identity with {P1.Handle} and who reside in approved jurisdictions may establish and fund a U.S. Dollar balance (&quot;USD Wallet&quot;). Except as otherwise set forth herein, you may use your USD Wallet only to purchase bitcoin from {P1.Handle}, to receive the proceeds of bitcoin sales to {P1.Handle}, or to transfer funds to and from a {P1.Handle} Trading Account. {P1.Handle} holds all customers&#39; USD Wallet funds in a dedicated account at an FDIC-insured financial institution.

5.2. Deposits and Withdrawals

.sec=You may visit your Account at {P1_com}/accounts and click on &quot;USD Wallet&quot; to transfer funds between your linked bank account and {P1.Handle} as necessary to deposit funds into or withdraw funds from your USD Wallet. {P1.Handle} will not charge a fee for you to transfer funds to or from {P1.Handle}, but bank transfer fees may apply. Funds sent via bank wire (if permitted by {P1.Handle}) are subject to additional wire fees. For deposits, {P1.Handle} will credit your USD Wallet a corresponding amount of dollars after funds are delivered to {P1.Handle}, typically within two to three business days after you authorize a deposit. For withdrawals, {P1.Handle} will immediately debit your USD Wallet when you authorize a withdrawal and funds will typically settle to you within two to three business days. Bank fees are netted out of transfers to or from {P1.Handle}. We will not process a transfer if associated bank fees exceed the value of the transfer.

5.3. USD Wallet Transactions

.sec=When you purchase bitcoin, you may opt to use funds in your USD Wallet rather than your linked payment method. If you purchase bitcoin using your USD Wallet, {P1.Handle} will ordinarily effect an immediate settlement of funds, with bitcoin credited to your Bitcoin Wallet, although {P1.Handle} reserves the right to delay any such transaction if it perceives a risk of fraud or illegal activity. When you sell bitcoin to {P1.Handle}, you may elect to receive the proceeds of such sale into your USD Wallet. {P1.Handle} will ordinarily effect an immediate settlement of funds, with U.S. Dollars credited to your USD Wallet, although {P1.Handle} reserves the right to delay any such transaction if it perceives a risk of fraud or illegal activity.

5.4. Limits

.sec=You may not initiate a deposit which exceeds your daily bitcoin buy limits. {P1.Handle} reserves the right to restrict deposits into your USD Wallet and/or to require you to withdraw funds from your USD Wallet if {P1.Handle} determines that your USD Wallet has reached an excessive balance. You may not purchase or sell bitcoin in excess of your daily buy / sell limits, set forth below, regardless of the amount of funds held in your USD Wallet.

Part 2. Additional Terms for {Merchants}

1. {Merchant_Services}

1.1. {Merchant_Services}

.sec=Users who intend to sell goods and/or services (each, a &quot;{Merchant}&quot;) and who wish to accept bitcoin from purchasers as a method of payment may use a suite of tools and related services for this purpose (the &quot;{Merchant_Services}&quot;). Through the {Merchant_Services}, {P1.Handle} enables Merchants to accept bitcoin from customers as a method of payment, and processes the transfer of bitcoin to Merchants from their customers. Merchants may also sell bitcoin to, or buy bitcoin from, {P1.Handle}, and otherwise utilize the {P1_Services}, in the same manner as any other user. Use of {Merchant_Services} is subject to this Part 2 and is also subject to General Use terms, including without limitation the releases, indemnities, disclaimers, limitations of liability, prohibited use, dispute resolution, and cancellation policies set forth above.

1.2 {Merchant} Profile

.sec=Each {Merchant} user is required to provide accurate information necessary to complete a merchant profile associated with the user&#39;s {P1_Account}. This information may include business name, address and other contact information, website URL, taxpayer or other government ID, corporate documents, and other information {P1.Handle} may request. {P1.Handle} may limit {Merchant} transaction volumes depending on (<em>i</em>) the {Merchant}&#39;s historical activity on {P1.Handle}, (<em>ii</em>) satisfactory completion of a {Merchant} profile; (<em>iii</em>) satisfaction of reasonable requests for additional information; (<em>iv</em>) perceived risks; (<em>v</em>) repeated customer complaints; and/or (<em>vi</em>) any indication that the {Merchant} has violated {this_Agreement}. Newly-boarded {Merchants} may be required to submit to additional verification procedures as necessary to verify that the {Merchant} operates a legitimate business.

2. {Merchant} Transactions and Settlement

2.1. Transaction Confirmation

.sec= {P1.Handle} will provide users of {Merchant_Services} with an order notification indicating when or whether the {Merchant} has been paid by its customer.

2.1.1. Completed Order Notifications

.sec=Upon {Merchant}&#39;s customer&#39;s submission of a valid and accurate order through {Merchant_Services}, {P1.Handle} will immediately send a callback to {Merchant}&#39;s designated callback URL to confirm successful transfer of the customer&#39;s payment to {Merchant}—so designated as a &quot;completed&quot; order. Except on suspicion of fraud, error, or abusive use, {P1.Handle} will not reverse a payment and/or corresponding bitcoin credit which it has designated as completed.

2.1.2. Timing of Completed Order

.sec=If the {Merchant}&#39;s customer uses a {P1.Handle} wallet to successfully initiate its purchase, {P1.Handle} will issue the completed callback order immediately to the {Merchant}. If the {Merchant}&#39;s customer does not use a {P1.Handle} wallet to effect its purchase, {P1.Handle} will initiate an order status callback when {P1.Handle} detects that the {Merchant}&#39;s customer has initiated a transaction which is broadcast through the {Bitcoin_network}.

2.1.3. Mispaid Order Notifications

.sec=A callback may also indicate an order status as &quot;mispaid,&quot; meaning {P1.Handle} has detected transfer of an amount of bitcoin not corresponding with the Bitcoin Price and/or that the customer transferred bitcoin after expiration of a checkout window. &quot;Mispaid&quot; orders may result in transfer of bitcoin to {Merchant}&#39;s {P1_Wallet} for further processing by {Merchant} in accordance with {Merchant}&#39;s refund and order processing policies, but shall not be deemed completed by {P1.Handle}.

2.1.4 Limitations

.sec={P1.Handle} may delay order verifications if {Merchant} has not provided its legal name, logo, website, phone number, address, taxpayer identification number, designation of business location and type. Until completion of such verification procedures, newly-boarded {Merchants} may experience delayed processing of {Bitcoin_Transactions} or Conversion Service transactions. {P1.Handle} will designate any such delayed transaction as &quot;pending,&quot; and funds will not be available in the {Merchant}&#39;s {P1_Account} and/or Currency Account until the pending transaction is completed. {P1.Handle} reserves the right to refuse to process, cancel, or to reverse any {Merchant} transaction (<em>i</em>) as required by law, (<em>ii</em>) in response to a facially valid subpoena, court order, or other government order, or (<em>iii</em>) if {P1.Handle} reasonably suspects that the transaction is erroneous, or related to [Prohibited Use or Prohibited Business] (#toc_11) as defined in the {User_Agreement}.

2.2. Instant Conversion

.sec={P1.Handle} may offer its optional instant Conversion Service (the &quot;Instant Conversion Service,&quot; also referred to as &quot;Instant Exchange&quot;) to {Merchants} who have successfully linked a payout method to their {P1_Account}. The Instant Conversion Service will allow {Merchants} to designate the price of their goods and services in local currency (e.g., USD) and customers to pay for their purchases from such {Merchant} in bitcoin based on the Sell Price Conversion Rate quoted by {P1.Handle} on the {P1_Site} and displayed to the customer at the time that the customer approves the purchase. In connection with the Instant Conversion Service, the {Merchant}, as merchant of record for each transaction, shall: (<em>i</em>) use {P1.Handle} to calculate an appropriate amount of bitcoin (a &quot;Bitcoin Price&quot;) to be transferred to {Merchant} as payment for a good or service with reference to the Sell Price Conversion Rate at the time {Merchant}&#39;s customer visits the {Merchant}&#39;s checkout page; {P1.Handle} will lock the Bitcoin Price for a period of time, but if the customer does not initiate a transfer within a certain payment window, {P1.Handle} will recalculate the Bitcoin Price based on an updated Sell Price Conversion Rate; (<em>ii</em>) accept bitcoin into its corresponding Bitcoin Wallet; (<em>iii</em>) immediately sell such bitcoin to {P1.Handle} using the Instant Conversion Service, and (<em>iv</em>) subsequently receive the proceeds from such bitcoin sale transaction from {P1.Handle} in the relevant local currency in an amount equal to the original USD price of the item, less applicable fees. By using this service, {P1.Handle} guarantees that regardless of any change in the price of bitcoin between the time of purchase and settlement, the {Merchant} will receive the fixed purchase price as designated by the {Merchant} in local currency at the time the customer approved the purchase, less applicable fees.

2.3. Settlement

.sec=Settlements to {Merchant} in connection with the {Merchant}&#39;s sale of bitcoin to {P1.Handle} will generally take a minimum of two to three business days, following {P1.Handle}&#39;s transmission to {Merchant} of confirmation of the relevant transaction, although exceptions may apply.

3. Release, Restrictions, and General Use

3.1 {Merchant} Transactions

.sec=Each {Merchant} acknowledges and agrees that {P1.Handle} has no control over, or liability for, the delivery, quality, safety, legality or any other aspect of any goods or services that the {Merchant} may sell to customers using the {P1_Services}. Each {Merchant} is responsible for handling customer inquiries related to the goods and/or services it sells to customers through the {P1_Services}, except for inquiries related to payment for such goods or services which will be handled by {P1.Handle}.

Part 3. {P1_Exchange}

1. Trading Accounts

1.1 {P1_Exchange}

.sec=Verified users in approved jurisdictions may participate in a trading platform which will allow users to buy bitcoin from and/or sell bitcoin to other {P1.Handle} users (the &quot;{P1_Exchange}&quot;). The {P1_Exchange} will: (<em>a</em>) allow you to place orders to buy or sell bitcoin in designated quantities and prices (an &quot;Order&quot;) into a first-come, first-served order book (the &quot;Order Book&quot;); (<em>b</em>) match compatible Orders among anonymous counterparties on the {P1_Exchange}; and (<em>c</em>) automatically execute trades resulting from matched Orders by settling the corresponding transfers of bitcoin and currency among the trading counterparties&#39; Trading Account wallets (such settled orders, &quot;Trades&quot;). Use of {P1_Exchange} is subject to this Part 3 and is also subject to the General Use terms, including without limitation the indemnities, releases, disclaimers, limitations of liability, prohibited use, dispute resolution, and cancellation policies set forth above. {P1_Exchange} functionality is described in further detail at <a href="https://docs.exchange.{P1_com}/">https://docs.exchange.{P1_com}/</a>.

1.2 Trading Account

.sec=After you have established a {P1_Account}, inclusive with USD Wallet, you may visit the {P1_Exchange} at <a href="https://exchange.{P1_com}">https://exchange.{P1_com}</a> to establish a dedicated Bitcoin Wallet and dedicated USD Wallet expressly for the purpose of placing Orders and settling Trades on the {P1_Exchange} (such dedicated wallets, together with associated user tools, a &quot;Trading Account&quot;). You may not place Orders on the {P1_Exchange} until you have transferred bitcoin and/or currency from your basic {P1_Account} wallets into your Trading Account wallets. Funds in your Trading Account wallets can be used only to place Orders and to execute Trades and cannot be used for any other purpose.

1.3 Transfers and Limits

.sec=You can transfer bitcoin and/or currency between your basic {P1_Account} wallets and your Trading Account wallets instantly and free of charge in an amount less than or equal to applicable daily trade limits set forth in the {User_Agreement}. {P1.Handle} monitors the total value of assets associated with your Trading Account and we reserve the right to prevent transfers to your Trading Account, to suspend your trading activity, and/or to require you to withdraw funds from your Trading Account if your total Trading Account balance exceeds your daily trade limits. You may request heightened trading limits pursuant to Coinbase {Enhanced_Due_Diligence} procedures set forth in the {User_Agreement}. You may withdraw funds from your Trading Account by transferring the funds to your basic {P1_Account} wallets, at which point you may remove funds from the Coinbase platform in accordance with Coinbase policies and subject to applicable bank transfer fees.

2. Orders, Trades, and Fees

2.1 Orders and Trades

.sec=Trading Account tools allow you to place Orders in the {P1_Exchange} Order Book by designating an amount of bitcoin you wish to buy or sell at a designated fiat currency-denominated price. When an Order is matched, in part or in full, to one or more compatible counter-orders, one or more Trades are immediately executed as set forth below.

2.1.1 Takers

.sec=If your Order is immediately paired to one or more counter-orders, you are a &quot;Taker&quot; and the Order will result in an immediately executing Trade at the price of the preexisting Order in the Order Book. Such Trade is immediately reflected in the Taker&#39;s Trade history and as corresponding credits and debits to the Taker&#39;s Trading Account wallet balances. Takers are charged a commission fee (described below), automatically debited from the Taker&#39;s Trading Account USD Wallet.

2.1.2. Makers

.sec=If your Order is not immediately paired to a matching counter-order, you are a &quot;Maker&quot; and your Order will remain open in the Order Book until either (<em>i</em>) the Order is cancelled, or (<em>ii</em>) the Order is matched to a counter-order on the {P1_Exchange} and a Trade is executed. Coinbase will block use and transfer of funds in the Maker&#39;s Trading Account corresponding to any open Order. The Maker can release the block by cancelling the Order without charge. When a matching counter-order is placed in the Order Book, the Maker&#39;s open Order will result in an executed Trade at the price the Maker posted to the Order Book, immediately reflected in the Maker&#39;s Trade history and as corresponding credits and debits to the Maker&#39;s Trading Account wallet balances.

2.1.3. Partial Order Execution

.sec=Your Order may be executed in parts depending on the availability of compatible counter-orders on the {P1_Exchange}. The Trade resulting from an immediate, partial execution is subject to Taker commissions as described above. Any unfulfilled remainder of such partially-executed Order will remain as an open, Maker Order in the Order Book until it is either cancelled or executed.

2.1.4. Taker Price Improvement

.sec=Taker Orders are matched against existing Maker Orders at the price of the Maker Order posted in the Order Book, not at the price of the Taker Order. Coinbase will automatically match a Taker Order to any open Order whose price is at least as favorable as the Taker&#39;s Order price, if not more favorable to the Taker. Maker Orders will always be executed at the posted Order Book price.

2.1.5. Self-Trade Prevention

.sec=Coinbase will prevent you from entering Orders which would result in self-execution—<em>i.e</em>., where you act as both Maker and Taker to a Trade. In the event that any open or partially open Order would result in self-execution, Coinbase will automatically cancel the smaller quantity open Order, decrement the larger quantity Order in an amount equivalent to the cancelled quantity, and allow the remainder of the larger Order to remain open. If two such Orders are the same quantity, both will be cancelled.

2.2. Alternative Order Instructions

.sec=The {P1_Exchange} may allow you to input alternative Order parameters which differ from the default parameters set forth above. Alternative Order parameters, such as those preventing partial Order execution and/or which affect the timing of your Trades, will be described at: <a href="https://docs.exchange.{P1_com}">https://docs.exchange.{P1_com}</a>.

2.3. Fees

.sec={P1_Exchange} operates a maker-taker pricing model in which we will charge a commission to the Taker of any given Trade. We will not charge a commission to Makers. Commissions are denominated in the quote currency—typically U.S. Dollars—and automatically debited from the Taker&#39;s Trading Account USD Wallet upon settlement of a Trade. Applicable commissions and other fees (if any) are posted at: <a href="https://docs.exchange.{P1_com}/#fees">https://docs.exchange.{P1_com}/#fees</a>. By using the {P1_Exchange} you agree to pay all applicable Coinbase fees and trade-based commissions and you authorize Coinbase to deduct directly from your Trading Account wallets the applicable commissions and other fees at the time of first accrual or subsequently if any amounts are unpaid.

3. General Use, Restrictions, and Cancellation

3.1. Trading Account Use

.sec=By using a Trading Account you agree and represent that you will make Trades only for yourself as Account owner, and not on a pass-through basis on behalf of any third party, unless you have obtained prior approval from Coinbase. You may not sell, lease, furnish or otherwise permit or provide access to your Trading Account to any other entity or to any individual that is not your employee or agent. You accept full responsibility for your employees&#39; or agents&#39; use of the {P1_Exchange}, whether such use is directly through the {P1_Exchange} website or by other means, such as those facilitated through Auth permissions, API keys, and/or applications which you may authorize. You understand and agree that you are responsible for any and all orders, trades, and other instructions entered into the {P1_Exchange} under identifiers, permissions, passwords, and security codes associated with your {P1_Account}.

3.2. Suspension and Cancellation

.sec=We may suspend your Trading Account in accordance with the {User_Agreement} Account suspension and termination provisions. Suspension or termination of you Account shall not affect the payment of fees or other amounts you owe to Coinbase. In the event that your {P1_Account} is suspended or terminated, we will immediately cancel all open Orders associated with your Trading Account and bar the placing of further Orders until resolution or Account cancellation.

3.3. No Warranty

.sec=We do not represent that {P1_Exchange} and/or its constituent Trading Accounts, APIs, and related services, will be available without interruption. Although we will strive to provide you with continuous operations, we do not guarantee continuous access or that there will be no delays, failures, errors, omissions or loss of transmitted information, nor do we guarantee that any Order will be executed, accepted, recorded, or remain open. In the event of a significant system outage, Coinbase reserves the right to cancel any open trades and/or suspend {P1_Exchange} activity indefinitely.

3.4. No Investment Advice or Brokerage

.sec=For the avoidance of doubt, Coinbase does not provide investment, tax, or legal advice, nor does Coinbase broker trades on your behalf. All {P1_Exchange} trades are executed automatically, based on the parameters of your Order instructions and in accordance with posted Trade execution procedures, and you are solely responsiblefor determining whether any investment, investment strategy or related transaction is appropriate for you based on your personal investment objectives, financial circumstances and risk tolerance. You should consult your legal or tax professional regarding your specific situation.

3.5. Trade Cancellation

.sec=Except as otherwise set forth herein, all trades are final and commissions and/or fees paid to Coinbase are non-refundable. Coinbase reserves the right to cancel Orders which, in our sole discretion, constitute an abusive use of the platform. We also reserve the right to cancel Orders, which under the circumstances appear clearly erroneous with respect to price, quantity, or other parameters. Coinbase reserves the right to restrict trade size or frequency in its sole discretion or limit API use which unreasonably burdens the platform.
3.6. Debts

.sec=In the event that there are outstanding amounts owed to us hereunder, Coinbase reserves the right to debit your Trading Account wallets accordingly and/or to withhold amounts from funds you may transfer from your Trading Account wallets to your {P1_Account} wallets. In the event that you have a negative balance in a {P1_Account} wallet, the transfer of funds from your Trading Account to your {P1_Account} will be applied first to satisfy any negative balance before crediting your Account.
