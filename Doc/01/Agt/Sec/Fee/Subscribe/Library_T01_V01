1.Sec=<b>Free Quota.</b>  Certain {Services} are provided to {P2.Handle} without charge up to the {Fee_Threshold}, as applicable.

2.Sec=<b>Online Billing.</b>  {P1.Handle} will issue an electronic bill to {P2.Handle} for all charges accrued above the {Fee_Threshold} based on (i) {P2.Handle}’s use of the {Services} during the {License_Term} (including, if any, the relevant {TSS_Fee} set forth in the {Fees} definition below); (ii) any {Reserved_Units} selected; (iii) any {Committed_Purchases} selected; and/or (iv) any {Package_Purchases} selected. For use above the {Fee_Threshold}, {P2.Handle} will be responsible for all {Fees} up to the amount set in the {Account} and will pay all {Fees} in U.S. Dollars or in such other currency as agreed to in writing by the parties.  {P2.Handle} will pay all {Fees} in accordance with the payment terms applicable to the {Fees}. {P1.Handle}'s measurement of {P2.Handle}’s use of the {Services} is final.

3.Sec=<b>{Taxes}.</b>  {P2.Handle} is responsible for any {Taxes}, and {P2.Handle} will pay {P1.Handle} for the {Services} without any reduction for {Taxes}.  If {P1.Handle} is obligated to collect or pay {Taxes}, the {Taxes} will be invoiced to {P2.Handle}, unless {P2.Handle} provides {P1.Handle} with a timely and valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.  In some states the sales tax is due on the total purchase price at the time of sale and must be invoiced and collected at the time of the sale.  If {P2.Handle} is required by law to withhold any {Taxes} from its payments to {P1.Handle}, {P2.Handle} must provide {P1.Handle} with an official tax receipt or other appropriate documentation to support such withholding.
 
4.Sec=<b>Invoice Disputes & Refunds.</b>  To the fullest extent permitted by law, {P2.Handle} waives all claims relating to {Fees} unless claimed within sixty days after charged (this does not affect any {P2.Handle} rights with its credit card issuer).  Refunds (if any) are at the discretion of {P1.Handle} and will only be in the form of credit for the {Services}.  Nothing in {this Agreement} obligates {P1.Handle} to extend credit to any party.

5.Sec=<b>Delinquent Payments.</b>  Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less).  {P1.Handle} reserves the right to suspend Customer’s {Account} for any late payments.
