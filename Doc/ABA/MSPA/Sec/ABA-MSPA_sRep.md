EmpBenefit.Ti=EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

EmpBenefit.01.Sec=Part {3.13(a)} lists each "employee benefit plan" as defined by Section 3(3) of ERISA, all specified fringe benefit plans as defined in Section 6039D of the Code, and all other bonus, incentive-compensation, deferred-compensation, profit-sharing, stock-option, stock-appreciation-right, stock-bonus, stock-purchase, employee-stock-ownership, savings, severance, change-in-control, supplemental-unemployment, layoff, salary-continuation, retirement, pension, health, life-insurance, disability, accident, group-insurance, vacation, holiday, sick-leave, fringe-benefit, or welfare plan, and any other employee compensation or benefit plan, policy, practice, or {Contract} (whether qualified or nonqualified, effective or terminated, written or unwritten) and any trust, escrow, or other {Contract} related thereto that (i) is maintained or contributed to by any {Acquired_Company} and (ii) provides benefits to, or describes policies or procedures applicable to, any current or former director, officer, employee, or service provider of any {Acquired_Company}, or the dependents of any thereof, regardless of how (or whether) liabilities for the provision of benefits are accrued or assets are acquired or dedicated with respect to the funding thereof (each, an "Employee Plan").  Part {3.13(a)} identifies as such any Employee Plan that is (x) a plan intended to meet the requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code or (y) a plan subject to Title IV of ERISA.  Other than the {Acquired_Companies}, no corporation or trade or business has ever been controlled by, controlling, or under common control with any {Seller} within the meaning of Section 414 of the Code or Section 4001(a)(14) or 4001(b) of ERISA.

EmpBenefit.02.Sec={Sellers} have delivered to {Buyer} copies of (i) the documents comprising each Employee Plan (or, with respect to an Employee Plan which is unwritten, a detailed written description of eligibility, participation, benefits, funding arrangements, assets, and any other matters that relate to the obligations of any {Acquired_Company} thereunder); (ii) all trust agreements, insurance contracts, or any other funding instruments related to each Employee Plan; (iii) all rulings, determination letters, no-action letters, or advisory opinions from the IRS, the United States Department of Labor, or any other {Governmental_Body} that pertain to each Employee Plan and any open requests therefor; (iv) the most recent actuarial and financial reports (audited and/or unaudited) and the annual reports filed with any {Governmental_Body} with respect to each Employee Plan during the current year and each of the three preceding years; (v) all {Contract}s with third-party administrators, actuaries, investment managers, consultants, or other independent contractors that relate to each Employee Plan; and (vi) all summary plan descriptions, summaries of material modifications and memoranda, employee handbooks, and other written communications regarding each Employee Plan.

EmpBenefit.03.Sec=Except as set forth in Part {3.13(c)}, all amounts owed by any {Acquired_Company} under the terms of any Employee Plan have been timely paid in full.  Except as set forth in Part 3.13(c), each Employee Plan that provides health or welfare benefits is fully insured, and any incurred but not reported claims under each such Employee Plan that is not fully insured have been properly accrued.  Each {Acquired_Company} has paid in full all required insurance premiums, subject only to normal retrospective adjustments in the Ordinary Course of Business, with regard to each Employee Plan.

EmpBenefit.04.Sec=Each {Acquired_Company} has complied with the applicable continuation requirements for each Employee Plan, including (i) Section 4980B of the Code (as well as its predecessor provision, Section 162(k) of the Code) and Sections 601 through 608, inclusive, of ERISA ("COBRA") and (ii) any applicable state {Legal_Requirement}s mandating welfare benefit continuation coverage for employees.

EmpBenefit.05.Sec=The form of each Employee Plan is in compliance with the applicable terms of ERISA, the Code, and any other applicable {Legal_Requirement}, including the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993, and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and each Employee Plan has been operated in compliance with such {Legal_Requirements} and the written Employee Plan documents.  No {Acquired_Company} and no fiduciary of an Employee Plan has violated the requirements of Section 404 of ERISA.  Each required report and description of an Employee Plan (including IRS Form 5500 Annual Reports, Summary Annual Reports and Summary Plan Descriptions, and Summaries of Material Modifications) have been (to the extent required) timely filed with the IRS, the United States Department of Labor, or other {Governmental_Body} and distributed as required, and all notices required by ERISA or the Code or any other {Legal_Requirement} with respect to each Employee Plan have been appropriately given.  No {Acquired_Company} has any unfunded liability with respect to any deferred compensation, retirement, or other Employee Plan.

EmpBenefit.06.Sec=Each Employee Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received, or is based on a form of plan that has received, a favorable determination letter from the IRS, which is current, taking into account the Tax laws referred to as "GUST."  To the Knowledge of {Sellers}, no circumstance exists that could result in revocation of any such favorable determination letter.  Each trust created under any such Employee Plan has been determined to be exempt from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code, and, to the Knowledge of {Sellers}, no circumstance exists that could result in a revocation of such exemption.  No Employee Plan is intended to meet the requirements of Code Section 501(c)(9).  No circumstance exists that could give rise to a loss of any intended tax consequence or to any Tax under Section 511 of the Code with respect to any Employee Plan.

EmpBenefit.07.Sec=There has never been any Proceeding relating to any Employee Plan and, to the Knowledge of {Sellers}, no such Proceeding is threatened.  To the Knowledge of {Sellers}, no event has occurred or circumstance exists that could give rise to or serve as a basis for the commencement of any such Proceeding.  No {Acquired_Company} and no fiduciary of an Employee Plan has engaged in a transaction with respect to any Employee Plan that could subject any {Acquired_Company} or {Buyer} to a Tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(l) of ERISA or a violation of Section 406 of ERISA.  Neither the execution and delivery of {this_Agreement} nor the consummation or performance of any {Contemplated_Transaction} will, directly or indirectly (with or without notice or lapse of time), result in the assessment of a Tax or penalty under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(l) of ERISA or result in a violation of Section 406 of ERISA.

EmpBenefit.08.Sec=Neither the execution and delivery of {this_Agreement} nor the consummation or performance of any {Contemplated_Transaction} will, directly or indirectly (with or without notice or lapse of time), obligate any {Acquired_Company} to pay any separation, severance, termination, or similar benefit to, or accelerate the time of vesting for, change the time of payment to, or increase the amount of compensation due to, any director, employee, officer, former employee, or former officer of any {Acquired_Company}.  There is no {Contract} providing for payments that could subject any {Person} to liability under Section 4999 of the Code.

EmpBenefit.09.Sec=Other than the continuation coverage requirements of COBRA, no {Acquired_Company} has any obligation or potential liability for benefits to employees, former employees, or their dependents following termination of employment or retirement under any Employee Plan.

EmpBenefit.10.Sec=Neither the execution and delivery of {this_Agreement} nor the consummation or performance of any {Contemplated_Transaction} will, directly or indirectly (with or without notice or lapse of time), result in an amendment, modification, or termination of any Employee Plan.  No written or oral representation has been made to any employee or former employee of any {Acquired_Company} promising or guaranteeing any employer payment or funding for the continuation of medical, dental, life, or disability coverage for any period of time beyond the end of the current plan year (except to the extent of coverage required under COBRA).  No written or oral representation has been made to any employee or former employee of any {Acquired_Company} concerning the employee benefits of {Buyer}.

EmpBenefit.11.Sec=No {Acquired_Company} contributes to, has any obligation to contribute to, or has any liability with respect to, any "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA that is a "defined benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(35) of ERISA.

EmpBenefit.12.Sec=No {Acquired_Company} contributes to, has any obligation to contribute to, or has any liability with respect to, a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA or Section 414(f) of the Code or a plan that has two or more contributing sponsors, at least two of whom are not under common control within the meaning of Section 413(c) of the Code.

EmpBenefit.13.Sec=Except as set forth in Part 3.13(m), no Employee Plan is subject to Section 409A of the Code.  Each Employee Plan subject to Section 409A of the Code ("Deferred Compensation Plan") complies in all material respects with Section 409A of the Code.  No {Acquired_Company} has (i) granted to any {Person} an interest in any Deferred Compensation Plan that is, or upon the lapse of a substantial risk of forfeiture with respect to such interest will be, subject to the Tax imposed by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) or (b)(4)(A) of the Code, or (ii) materially modified any Deferred Compensation Plan in a manner that could cause an interest previously granted under such plan to become subject to the Tax imposed by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) or (b)(4) of the Code.
