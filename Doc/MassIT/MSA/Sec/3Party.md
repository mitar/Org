Ti=THIRD PARTY VENDORS

1.Ti=Subcontractors

1.1.Sec=Client and Contractor acknowledge and agree that third-party Advisers or other third-party providers (collectively, “Third Party Vendors”) may, from time to time, provide Third Party Software, Third Party Equipment or Third Party Services in support of the Project; provided, however, that any Services provided by Contractor’s Affiliates or by staff augmentation contractors shall not constitute Third Party Services, and Contractor’s Affiliates and staff augmentation contractors shall not constitute Third Party Vendors provided that Contractor shall remain responsible for all acts and omissions of Contractor’s Affiliates and staff augmentation contractors. Any Third Party Services provided by a Subcontractor must be provided under a Subcontract complying with this Section 6.1. Client and Contractor agree that Contractor will serve as the prime contractor for each Subcontract, and will remain responsible for the performance of any Services provided by any such Subcontractor. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent Third Party Vendors are providing Client Provided Third Party Software, Client Provided Third Party Services and/or Client Provided Third Party Equipment, such Third Party Vendors are not Subcontractors. Client may enter into agreements directly with Third Party Vendors for the Services specified in the Task Orders, and no such agreement shall be construed to discharge Contractor from its obligations or liabilities to Client under this Agreement and with respect to the performance of all Services, except as expressly stated herein.

1.2.0.Sec=Contractor shall:

1.2.1.Sec=submit each proposed Subcontractor to Client for written approval, and obtain Client’s written approval (in each case, such approval or disapproval shall not be unreasonably delayed), prior to engaging any such Subcontractor to provide Third Party Services, Third Party Software or Third Party Equipment under this Agreement. Client’s failure to approve or disapprove a proposed Subcontractor on a timely basis shall be considered a Client Delay for the applicable Services to be provided by the proposed Subcontractor if Client’s failure adversely impacts Contractor’s ability to meet a Task Order delivery date related to the work proposed to be completed by the proposed Subcontractor;

1.2.2.Sec=with regard to Subcontracts with Third Party Vendors that will provide Third Party Services, execute a Subcontract that:

1.2.2.1.Sec=is consistent with the provisions of this Agreement;

1.2.2.2.Sec=unless otherwise agreed by Client in writing, requires the Subcontractor to be bound by the Flowdown Terms;

1.2.2.3.Sec=unless otherwise agreed by Client in writing, provides that the Subcontract may be assigned to Client at Client’s request (however, Client shall not require such right to assign if Contractor can demonstrate it has used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such ability to assign, and the proposed Subcontractor (I) has refused to provide the right to assign, (II) is the only source for the Third Party Service and (III) has not accepted the Commonwealth Terms in a current engagement); and

1.2.2.4.Sec=permits Client, at Client’s sole discretion, to, upon written notice to Contractor, pay directly to the Subcontractor any amounts owed by Contractor to such Subcontractor under the Subcontract, in the event that (I) Contractor has not paid such Subcontractor and the continued nonpayment of such Subcontractor materially compromises the Project or any System or (II) Contractor commences, or has commenced against it, proceedings under any bankruptcy, insolvency or debtor’s relief law, which proceedings are not dismissed within thirty (30) days;

1.2.2.=[01/Agt/Bit/Outline/1-4.Secs]

1.2.3.Sec=with regard to Subcontracts with Third Party Vendors that will provide Third Party Software or Third Party Equipment, utilize commercially reasonable efforts to execute a Subcontract that (A) is consistent with the provisions of this Agreement, (B) incorporates the Commonwealth Terms and Commonwealth Standard Form Contract (C) may be assigned upon Client’s request and (D) provides that the Third Party Vendor must indemnify Client for intellectual property infringement claims arising from the Third Party Software or Third Party Equipment;

1.2.4.Sec=obtain Client’s prior written consent to the terms of any Subcontract with a Key Subcontractor (in each case, such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). For avoidance of doubt, Client’s consent to the terms of any such Subcontract shall in no event be28 construed to waive, modify, amend or in any way alter the terms and conditions of this Agreement;

1.2.5.Sec=be responsible for managing each such Subcontractor’s performance under this Agreement;

1.2.6.Sec=continue to be responsible for the performance of the Services required by this Agreement, notwithstanding such Subcontractor’s performance (irrespective of any terms or limitations or exclusions of the Subcontract);

1.2.7.Sec=if such right exists, Contractor shall assign a Subcontract to Client upon Client’s request;

1.2.8.Sec=provide Client with copies of all draft Subcontracts with Key Subcontractors with an opportunity to review and comment prior to signing and final executed Subcontracts; and

1.2.9.Sec=defend, indemnify and hold Client harmless from and against any and all third party claims, actions, suits, proceedings, losses, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising out of or relating to Contractor’s failure to pay any Subcontractor, including any claim made by any Subcontractor against Client alleging nonpayment by Contractor. Unless and until a Subcontract is assigned to Client as described herein, Client shall not be required to seek a remedy against any Subcontractor (other than with respect to intellectual property infringement, as described below). However, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or a Task Order but without limiting Contractor’s obligations under subsection (b) above, (A) except for Key Subcontracts, to the extent permitted by the Subcontract, Client agrees to first seek available remedies for intellectual property infringement claims arising from Client’s use of the Third Party Software or Third Party Equipment directly from the Third Party Vendor and (B) following the assignment of a Subcontract to Client, if such assignment occurs, Client shall seek remedy related to and regarding such Subcontract against the Third Party Vendor and not against Contractor for claims arising under such Subcontract after the effective date of the assignment. Except in the event of the assignment by Contractor to Client of a Subcontract pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and except with regard to applicable use restrictions, including but not limited to license use restrictions and confidentiality, set forth in COTS maintenance, Software, license and hardware agreements between Contractor and Third Party Vendors for Third Party Software and/or Third Party Equipment provided by Contractor, in each case as reviewed and approved by Client in advance in writing, Client shall not be bound by any provisions contained in a Subcontract to which it is not a party. As of the Effective Date, hCentive is the only Key Subcontractor. For the avoidance of doubt, the agreement between hCentive and Contractor, a copy of which is attached hereto (for ease of reference purposes only) as Exhibit U (the29 “hCentive Agreement”) is a Subcontract hereunder and shall be subject to all the requirements of Section 6.1(b). Within five (5) days after initial deployment to Client of the hCentive Software, and within five (5) days after deployment to Client of each Release (as defined in Exhibit B-3 (Task Order 3)), Contractor will deliver or caused to be delivered to Client the archive copy of the object code for hCentive Software and such copy will be maintained in Client’s own storage system.

1.2.=[01/Agt/Bit/Outline/1-9.Secs]

1.3.Sec=Except for Key Subcontractors, Client and Contractor acknowledge that certain Subcontracts for Third Party Software and Third Party Equipment may not be executed prior to and/or simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement. Client and Contractor also acknowledge that during the Term of this Agreement, Contractor may propose additional Subcontractors. 

1.=[01/Agt/Bit/Outline/1-3.Secs]

2.Ti=Termination of Subcontract

2.0.Sec=In the event Contractor receives a notice of termination from any Key Subcontractor under any Subcontract, Contractor shall promptly notify Client of such notice of termination. If the parties agree (which may be determined by Emergency Meeting) that the Project would be best served by such Key Subcontractor continuing to perform under such Subcontract, Contractor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent such termination, and Contractor shall promptly mitigate any damages that may be incurred by Client as a result of the termination of the Subcontract. The termination of any Subcontract shall not eliminate or reduce Contractor’s obligations. In the event any Subcontract with a Key Subcontractor is terminated during the Term, Contractor shall promptly notify Client of such termination and (a) promptly locate a suitable replacement for such Key Subcontractor (which replacement, for clarity, will be subject to Client’s written approval in accordance with Section 6.1(b)(iv) above), if necessary, in order to meet Contractor’s obligation under this Agreement or (b) obtain the rights to any technology, know-how, expertise, labor, Personnel or any other rights that may be necessary to fulfill the obligations of Contractor under this Agreement, including any obligations that were delegated to such Key Subcontractor. Any such replacement Key Subcontractor must fulfill all of the applicable requirements set forth in this Agreement hereunder. 

3.Ti=Assignment of Subcontracts

3.sec=With respect to Subcontracts that are assignable to Client upon Client’s request as required under Section 6.1(b) above, within thirty (30) days of Client’s request that Contractor assign to Client such a Subcontract hereunder, or such other time period as mutually agreed by the parties, Contractor shall transfer, assign and convey to Client, by means of a written assignment agreement in such form reasonably satisfactory to Client, all the rights, title and interest of Assignor in, to and under such Subcontract, and delegate to Client all of Contractor’s future obligations and liabilities under the Subcontract. Following an assignment of a Subcontract by Contractor to Client pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, such Third Party Vendor shall no longer be a Subcontractor under this Agreement and Contractor shall not be responsible for the future performance of such Third Party Vendor. For avoidance of doubt, Contractor shall continue to be responsible for all claims of any kind or nature of Subcontractor or arising from such Subcontract that accrued prior to the effective date of the assignment of the Subcontract to Client.

4.Ti=Client Agreements With Third Party Vendors

4.sec=Client may enter into written agreements directly with Third Party Vendors for Client Provided Third Party Services such as hosting services, Client Provided Third Party Software and Client Provided Third Party Equipment, as specified in a Task Order (or as otherwise agreed upon by the parties). While Contractor shall assist in the management, coordination and communication with such Third Party Vendors, if and to the extent such agreement between Client and the Third Party Vendor allows Contractor to provide such support, Contractor shall not be responsible for the performance of such Third Party Vendors engaged directly by Client, or the Acceptance or performance of any such Client Provided Third Party Software, Client Provided Third Equipment or Client Provided Third Party Services unless such Third Party Vendors have been recommended by Contractor.
