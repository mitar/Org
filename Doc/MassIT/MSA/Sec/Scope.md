Ti=PURPOSE; SCOPE.

1.Ti=Overview.

1.1.Sec=The purpose of this Agreement is to enable Client, on behalf of the MassHealth program and the Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority (the “Connector”), to achieve the Work Streams as set forth in the recitals of this Agreement. The parties will use good faith efforts to conduct the Project in a manner consistent with the CMS Guide.

1.2.Sec=Each Task Order will be subject to an independent validation and verification process (the “IV&V Process”) during system development and implementation. Client, through a separate procurement, will hire a Third Party Vendor to perform the IV&V Process (the “IV&V Vendor”). The IV&V Vendor shall enter into a confidentiality agreement with Client to protect the confidentiality of Contractor’s Confidential Information as set forth in Section 15.1(b). Throughout the lifecycle of each Task Order, Contractor will be required to provide documentation and to meet with the Project management team and the IV&V Vendor to review the Project progress.

1.3.Sec=In Client’s discretion, including without limitation as a result of an IV&V Process described in the foregoing paragraph, Client may at any time during the Term initiate a procurement process to seek bids from other vendors for services provided by Contractor hereunder and that Contractor will be required to provide documentation and other information relating to the Services to Client and such bidders in connection with the procurement process (in which Contractor may be a participant); provided, however, that Contractor shall not be required to disclose Confidential Information that is not a public record as defined under Mass. Gen. Laws c. 4 § 7 cl. 26. Any such bidder shall enter into a confidentiality agreement with Client containing substantially similar terms as the confidentiality provisions set forth in Section 15 of this Agreement.
