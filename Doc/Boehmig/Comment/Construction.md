So this is another experiment.

Notice that defined terms in a document can link back to their source.  So we can document them there.  Provide clarification, commentary, alternatives. 

So, what might we say about defined terms?

Well, that if we use in a document the plural of a word or phrase that we have defined only in the singular, that the definition should influence the construction of the meaning of the pluralized form.  Not astonishing, but perhaps useful to mention.

Seriously, that terms embedded in a document can link to their sources means that we can layer meanings, and build.
