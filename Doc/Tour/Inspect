Working on the Environmental provisions of the Master Services Agreement.  
<br>=
So instead of rendering the whole doc, I want to render only the Environmental section.
<br>=
I attach the MSA:
Doc.=[Form/AGT/Master/Form]
<br>=
I then render just the Environment portion:
<br>=
Model.Root=<ol><li>{Doc.Environment._Sec}
