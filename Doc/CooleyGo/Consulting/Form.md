Consultant will provide, at Consultant’s own expense, a place of work and all equipment, tools and other materials necessary to complete the Services; however, to the extent necessary to facilitate performance of the Services, Client may, in its discretion, make its equipment or facilities available to Consultant at Consultant’s request.  While on the Client’s premises, Consultant agrees to comply with Client’s then-current access rules and procedures, including those related to safety, security and confidentiality.  Consultant agrees and acknowledges that Consultant has no expectation of privacy with respect to Client’s telecommunications, networking or information processing systems (including stored computer files, email messages and voice messages) and that Consultant’s activities, including the sending or receiving of any files or messages, on or using those systems may be monitored, and the contents of such files and messages may be reviewed and disclosed, at any time, without notice.

2.Ti=Compensation

2.sec=Client will pay Consultant the fee set forth in each Project Assignment for Services rendered pursuant to this Agreement as Consultant’s sole compensation for such Services.  Consultant will be reimbursed only for expenses that are expressly provided for in a Project Assignment or which have been approved in advance in writing by Client, provided Consultant has furnished such documentation for authorized expenses as Client may reasonably request.  Payment of Consultant’s fees and expenses will be in accordance with terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Project Assignment.  Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, Consultant will be paid fees on the basis stated in the Project Assignment(s) for work which has been completed.

3.Ti=Ownership of Work Product

3.sec=Consultant agrees that any and all Work Product shall be the sole and exclusive property of Client.

Consultant retains no rights to use the Work Product and agrees not to challenge the validity of Client’s ownership of the Work Product. Consultant agrees to execute, at Client’s request and expense, all documents and other instruments necessary or desirable to confirm such assignment, including without limitation, the copyright assignment set forth as EXHIBIT B (“Assignment of Copyright”) and the patent assignment set forth as EXHIBIT C (“Assignment of Patent Application”).  In the event that Consultant does not, for any reason, execute such documents within a reasonable time after Client’s request, Consultant hereby irrevocably appoints Client as Consultant’s attorney-in-fact for the purpose of executing such documents on Consultant’s behalf, which appointment is coupled with an interest. Consultant will deliver any Deliverables in accordance with the applicable Project Assignment and disclose promptly in writing to Company all other Work Product. 

4.Ti=Other Rights

4.sec=If Consultant has any rights, including without limitation “artist’s rights” or “moral rights,” in the Work Product which cannot be assigned,  Consultant hereby unconditionally and irrevocably grants to Client an exclusive (even as to Consultant), worldwide, fully paid and royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual license, with rights to sublicense through multiple tiers of sublicensees, to use, reproduce, distribute, create derivative works of, publicly perform and publicly display the Work Product in any medium or format, whether now known of later developed.  In the event that Consultant has any rights in the Work Product that cannot be assigned or licensed, Consultant unconditionally and irrevocably waives the enforcement of such rights, and all claims and causes of action of any kind against Client or Client’s customers.

5.Ti=License to Preexisting IP

5.sec=Consultant agrees not to use or incorporate into Work Product any intellectual property developed by any third party or by Consultant other than in the course of performing services for Client (“Preexisting IP”).

Consultant is solely responsible for, and must maintain adequate records of, expenses incurred in the course of performing Services under this Agreement.

Client will regularly report amounts paid to Consultant by filing Form 1099-MISC with the Internal Revenue Service as required by law.  If, notwithstanding the foregoing, Consultant is reclassified as an employee of Client, or any affiliate of Client, by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Department of Labor, or any other federal or state or foreign agency as the result of any administrative or judicial proceeding, Consultant agrees that Consultant will not, as the result of such reclassification, be entitled to or eligible for, on either a prospective or retrospective basis, any employee benefits under any plans or programs established or maintained by Client.
