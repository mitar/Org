Any breach or threatened breach of Sections {2.Xnum}, {3.Xnum} or {6.Xnum} this Agreement will cause irreparable harm to the Company for which damages would not be an adequate remedy, and, therefore, the Company is entitled to injunctive relief with respect thereto (without the necessity of posting any bond) in addition to any other remedies.
