0.0=This Standard Data Rights Distributed Management Services Agreement (&quot;Agreement&quot;) is effective as to any {Party} on the date of {Acceptance}of the {Online Registration} of any such Party (the &ldquo;Effective Date&rdquo;)(such party a &ldquo;Registered Party&rdquo;).
0.1.Title=Registered Party Rights and Obligations:
0.1.1=From and after the Effective Date, and until the {Termination Date}, any Registered Party in {Good Standing} under this Agreement shall enjoy the rights of a &ldquo;Data Rights Owner,&rdquo; and be subject to the obligations and affirmative duties of a &ldquo;Data User&rdquo; as the context requires, all as provided herein.&nbsp;
0.1.2=Hence, each Registered Party hereunder will have the status of a &ldquo;Data Rights Owner&rdquo; and &ldquo;Data User&rdquo; under this Agreement, but its rights and duties recognized under this Agreement will vary, as required, from those associated with one or the other status depending upon their roles in a particular {Data Action Event.}.&nbsp;References to &ldquo;Data Rights Owner&rdquo; and &ldquo;Data User&rdquo; hereunder are intended to convey such status differences as the context requires, and both terms are used alternately with references to &ldquo;Registered Party&rdquo; as the context requires.
0.1=<u>{0.1.Title}</u><br>{0.1.1}<br>{0.1.2}
0.2.Title=Registered Party in Its Role as Data Rights Owner Enjoys Distributed Data Rights Management Services:
0.2.1=The satisfactory performance by Registered Parties of their various duties under this Agreement in their capacity as Data Users, and their accountability therefor through mechanisms of enforcement under this Agreement (or cross referenced in the schedules hereof), {makes real}{gives effect to} the rights of Data Rights Owners under this Agreement, and carries into effect the system of distributed Data Rights Management &ldquo;Services&rdquo; (including the sub-categories of Services set forth in Section 3 hereof).
0.2.2=These Services are, in turn, enjoyed by Registered Parties in their respective capacities as Data Rights Owners in consideration of their provisional and conditional granting of various specific data rights under this Agreement to other Registered Parties acting as Data Users hereunder in order to secure such satisfactory performance.&nbsp;
0.2.3=The rights and duties hereunder are mutually dependent and are enforceable pursuant to this standard form contract, and each Registered Party is therefore {expected}{understood} to assume alternating roles under this Agreement. &nbsp;This Agreement documents an integrated and distributed network of dependencies in which it is in every Registered Party&rsquo;s self interest to perform the duties under the Agreement (in its capacity as both a Data User, and also those duties assigned to Registered Parties as Data Rights Owners) as an integrated legal structure designed to help auto-catalyze otherwise-unattainable security and leverage benefits for Registered Parties acting both as Data Rights Owners and as Data Users under this Agreement.&nbsp;
0.2=<u>{0.2.Title}</u><br>{0.2.1}<br>{0.2.2}<br>{0.2.3}
0.3.Title=Registered Party in the Role of Data User Enjoys Data Access, Cost Reduction and Risk/Liability Mitigation:
0.3.1=Not only does the satisfactory performance by a Registered Party of its various duties under this Agreement in its role as Data User qualify such Registered User for the protection of their rights as a Data Rights Owner hereunder; it also qualifies such Data User for the rights and benefits provided to Data Users under this Agreement.
0.3.2=Data User rights include, without limitation, (i) enhanced, co-managed access to higher quality Circulating Data and Vault Data under the terms hereof, (ii) various contractual &ldquo;safe harbors&rdquo; described herein, (iii) the benefits of conditional covenants by Registered Parties not to sue other Registered Parties in their respective capacities as Data Users with respect to objectively-testable, Agreement-conformant behavior, and (iv) other standards that can help to reduce the risk and cost to Data Users of interacting with data, and enhance access to valuable Circulating and Vault Data for Registered Parties as Data Users (consistent with and in furtherance of Data Rights Owners enforceable interests), all as provided further in this Agreement.
0.3=<u>{0.3.Title}</u><br>{0.3.1}<br>{0.3.2}
0.4.Title=Registered Parties are All Mutually Bound:
0.4.1=Upon Registration Acceptance (which follows the act of Registration for Registered Party {Applications} that meet {Acceptance Criteria}, which includes an affirmative agreement to the terms of this Agreement) each Registered Party is bound to all other Registered Parties to this Agreement, and hence into direct contractual &ldquo;privity&rdquo; with every other Registered Party.&nbsp; There are no third party beneficiary rights under the Agreement, which means that only Registered Parties can enjoy the contract rights under this Agreement, and only Registered Parties are bound to its terms.&nbsp;
0.4.2=To enjoy such rights, a party must agree to be bound to the duties of a Data User {and also the duties of a Data Rights Owner} hereunder, knowing that any and all Registered Parties in the entire population of Registered Parties can enforce this Agreement against any other Registered Party, including them, under the terms of this Agreement and as otherwise provided by applicable law.
0.4.3=Thus, when a party becomes a Registered Party, it owes duties under this Agreement to take actions relating to Vault Data and Circulating Data pursuant to described duties-of-care which conform to the obligations and responsibilities of a &ldquo;Data User&rdquo; hereunder, and they simultaneously become a beneficiary of the conformant performance by other Registered Parties to those standards-of-care.&nbsp; The conformant performance of such duties gives life to the legal rights of Data Rights Owner hereunder.&nbsp;&nbsp; (The use of a standard form agreement (such as this Agreement) across the entire population of Registered Parties assures that the rights and duties will extend to both bind and benefit all other Registered Parties, even those that a particular Registered Party will never meet in person.)
0.4.4=In the distributed legal architecture of this Agreement, the standardized, auditable, accountable, enforceable rights and duties connect each Registered Party to every other Registered Party, and create behavioral reliability that is the precursor to formalized, scalable &ldquo;trust&rdquo; among all Registered Parties and every other Registered Party.&nbsp; The system&rsquo;s reliability is built upon the distributed sources of a form of &ldquo;neighborhood watch&rdquo; constructed from the natural attentiveness of the stakeholders (borne of self-interest) regarding their respective rights under this Agreement (whether such rights are characterized as related to fundamental, civil, contractual, statutory, regulatory, or other rights in a given jurisdiction) and their ability to exercise private rights of action under this Agreement to enforce those rights.&nbsp;
0.4=<u>{0.4.Title}</u><br>{0.4.1}<br>{0.4.2}<br>{0.4.3}<br>{0.4.4}
0.5.Title=Supplemental Rights Permitted:
0.5.1=The various rights that are fostered by this Agreement, and are manifested in the Services under section 3, are each intended to deliver real benefit to realize the Data Rights Owners&rsquo; interests in the two general categories of &ldquo;data security/privacy&rdquo; and &ldquo;data leverage.&rdquo; &nbsp;The performance of the bundle of Data User duties by Registered Parties under this Agreement in their respective capacities as Data Users is enjoyed by Data Rights Owners as distributed Data Rights Management Services.
0.5.2=All Registered Parties will be equally bound to the obligations and duties set forth in this Agreement, provided that any sub-group of Registered Owners may agree to additional rights and duties that apply only to such sub-group, so long as they are not inconsistent with {(and promote)} those provided under this Agreement.
0.5.2=Thus, for example, commercial, governmental or civil society entities that institutionalize the provision of some or all of such &ldquo;Supplemental Services&rdquo; hereunder in their role as {Data User Intermediaries}, may offer various additional incentives, such as monetary payments and service enhancements, to attract Registered Parties to a particular set of Supplemental Services.&nbsp; In such a case, both Registered Parties will be aware that such Supplemental Services are required to be provided in a manner that is consistent with the Services hereunder, which Services are more broadly recognized beyond any such sub-group of Registered Parties to which such Supplemental Services apply, and which Services reflect the population-cohering behavioral artifact of a basic distributed legal infrastructure, documented in this Agreement, to support the distributed data architecture of the Internet.
0.5=<u>{0.5.Title}</u><br>{0.5.1}<br>{0.5.2}
0.6=For and in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein, the receipt, sufficiency, and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the Registered Parties, intending to be legally bound, hereby contract and agree as follows:
0={0.0}<br>{0.1}<br>{0.2}<br>{0.3}<br>{0.4}<br>{0.5}<br>{0.6}
1.Title=Background and Purpose; Agreement Standardizes a Set of Data Usage Duties and Supplements Other Agreements
1.1=This Agreement documents a set of mutually-dependent agreements associated with data-related exchanges and interactions between and among multiple Registered Parties, including both individuals and institutions, each of which is called a &ldquo;Registered Party&rdquo; and each of which alternately acts as a &quot;Data Rights Owner&quot; and {&quot;Data User&quot;}{&ldquo;Data Handler&rdquo;} (both as defined below), sometimes in both roles even within a related series of interactions..
1.2=The &ldquo;dual role&rdquo; of every Registered Party provides the incentive, balanced with obligation, that is a stabilizing influence in this data infrastructure for other economic/legal/social architectures upon which co-managed data rights management depends.&nbsp; Under this Agreement structure, to reduce one&rsquo;s own risk, a Registered Party must act in a way to help other Registered Parties to reduce their respective risks.&nbsp; The opportunity of a Party to enjoy the rights provided under this Agreement is conditioned upon their performance of duties under this Agreement.&nbsp; The interdependence of these contractual rights and duties in this document is intended to reflect and make reliable and enforceable their functional mutual interdependence so that data system reliability can be established as a foundation for online &ldquo;trust.&rdquo;
1.3=The Agreement structure seeks to create and deploy a distributed legal architecture to serve the needs of stakeholders engaging in data exchanges across data networks that depend upon a distributed data architecture, such as the Internet.&nbsp; Accordingly, under this Agreement, each Registered Party in its role as Data User shall, in consideration for enjoying its rights as Data User as set forth herein, abide by certain conditions and requirements associated with its access to such data (&ldquo;Data User Duties&rdquo;).
1.4=Every Registered Party&rsquo;s&rsquo; fulfillment of its promise to perform the duties assigned to it under this Agreement constitutes the successful &ldquo;recruitment&rdquo; of Registered Parties as Data Users to help achieve Registered Party&rsquo;s goals to enjoy rights (such as &ldquo;privacy&rdquo; and other data integrity rights) as Data Rights Owners.&nbsp; The performance of these standard duties by populations of Registered Parties/Data Users achieves risk and cost reduction at large scale for all Registered Parties, in ways that they cannot achieve unilaterally (and cannot even achieve among existing online data/identity standards consortia), and more effectively provides Data Rights Owner and Data Rights Owner&#39;s Affiliates (if that option is selected by Data Rights Owner) with functional, enforceable, accountable, &ldquo;crowd sourced,&rdquo; data rights management services (and related identity information-technology services) received from any party that comes into possession of Vault Data and Circulating Data in which Data Rights Owner has an interest, all on the terms and conditions set forth below.
1.5=To the extent that either the Data Rights Owner or Data User are, at any time while they are a party to this Agreement, parties to a separate legal agreement (or other legal obligation) through which Data User collects, stores, handles, uses, transfers, processes {other verbs here to cover standard set of &ldquo;Data Actions?&rdquo;} or otherwise has possession or access to data from, relating to or relatable to Data Rights Owner in accordance with that agreement and applicable local law or pursuant to which data about Data Rights Owner is shared with third-parties (whether such sharing is done on behalf of Data Rights Owner or Data User), as the case may be (each an &ldquo;Existing Agreement&rdquo;), the Registered Parties that are also the Parties thereto wish to continue to be bound by such Existing Agreements to define their legal relationships external to those set forth in this Agreement, and to supplement such Existing Agreements with the terms of this Agreement.&nbsp; The Parties mutually acknowledge and agree that the terms of this Agreement are supplemental to those of the Existing Agreement(s), and to the extent of any conflict between the terms of such agreements, the terms of this Agreement replace and supersede the terms and conditions of the Existing Agreements.
10.0.1=Data Rights Owner shall be the owner of all of the rights in Vault Meta Data that are equivalent to those recognized under this Agreement with respect to Vault Data generally, and which Vault Meta Data rights shall be treated (solely for purposes of describing their assignment in this section 10) in a manner like traditional, assignable copyright work product, and of all copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property and proprietary rights in the Vault Meta Data, if any.&nbsp; Data Rights Owner shall own all such Vault Meta Data rights equivalent to ownership in the Meta Data starting from the earlier of the date of collection or creation of such Vault Meta Data by or on behalf of the Data User.
10.0.2=Data User agrees and acknowledges that Data Rights Owner does not intend Data User to be a &ldquo;joint author&rdquo; of the Vault Meta Data within the meaning of {insert copyright convention reference?}{the Copyright Act of 1976 or equivalent copyright authority in a given jurisdiction}.
10.0.2=Each copyrightable element of the Vault Meta Data, if any, will be treated (solely for purposes of this section 10) in a manner similar to its being made as a &quot;work made for hire&quot; within the meaning of {insert copyright convention reference?}{the Copyright Act of 1976 or equivalent copyright authority in a given jurisdiction}.&nbsp; In addition, to the extent that the Vault Meta Data is not a &quot;work made for hire&quot; within the meaning of {insert copyright convention reference?}{the Copyright Act of 1976 or equivalent copyright authority in a given jurisdiction}, Data User hereby assigns all right, title, and interest in and to the Vault Meta Data, and all physical or other copies thereof, and including, but not limited to, the copyright, patent, trademark, trade secret, and all other proprietary rights in the Vault Meta Data exclusively to the Data Rights Owner, without any requirement for payment by Data Rights Owner to Data User, or any other retention of rights by Data User. &nbsp;Data User shall obtain agreement from any employees, independent contractors, or subcontractors of Data User that will perform any services relating to this Agreement, of similar obligations to those described above so as to ensure Data Rights Owner&#39;s acquisition of rights equivalent to ownership of the Vault Meta Data.
10.0.3=Data Rights Owner hereby grants to Data User a worldwide, non-transferable, non-exclusive personal license to use any Vault Meta Data solely to provide Services to Data Rights Owner and to produce Circulating Data pursuant to the terms and subject to the limitations of this Agreement, provided that any such Circulating Data produced from Vault Meta Data shall be treated as Circulating Data hereunder, as if it was produced from Vault Data.&nbsp; If and to the extent that Data Rights Owner agrees to the terms and conditions of the license agreement attached hereto as Exhibit____, Data User may use the Vault Meta Data in connection with the provision of Services to one or more of Data User&#39;s other customers.
10.0.4=The prior sentence shall not in any way restrict the rights of Data User to use Circulating Data that is created or generated from and with respect to any Vault Meta Data in the manner and to the extent contemplated by this Agreement, and Data User shall have all rights to use, distribute, copy, make derivative works of, perform, transfer and otherwise exploit Circulating Data that is derived from Vault Meta Data in a manner that is equivalent to that available to it with respect to Circulating Data that is derived from Vault Data.
10.0.5=Data User shall promptly and fully disclose and make available the Vault Meta Data to Data Rights Owner, and Data User shall execute and deliver any and all applications, assignments, and other documents that Data Rights Owner requests, at Data Rights Owner&rsquo;s expense, for protecting its rights in the Vault Meta Data worldwide. To the extent that such actions are required to confirm or perfect the rights of Data Rights Owner, Data Rights Owner shall have the full and sole power to prosecute such applications, and Data User shall cooperate fully, at the request and expense of Data Rights Owner, in the preparation and prosecution of all such applications and in any legal actions and proceedings concerning the Vault Meta Data.
10.0.6=Data User shall retain all right, title, and interest in all ideas, residuals, know-how, data, information, and techniques developed by Data User that are not Vault Meta Data, provided that Data User hereby grants to Data Rights Owner a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable, royalty-free license to use any such ideas, know-how, and techniques that are embedded in or otherwise inseparable from the Vault Meta Data.
10.0.7=Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, Data User shall not be obligated to erase any Circulating Data or transfer any Circulating Data to Data Rights Owner, even if such Circulating Data was derived from Vault Data originally contributed by such terminating Data Rights Owner.&nbsp; From and after such termination, and the corresponding return of Vault Data to the Data Rights Owner, Data User shall not create any additional Circulating Data from the Vault Data of such Terminating Data Rights Owner, if any, that remains in its possession or control, but may continue to use any Circulating Data derived prior to such date, and may generate Circulating Data from other Circulating Data so produced without limitation hereunder.

4.0.1=ESLs may be established for one or more of the following categories of services:
4.0.2=ESLs are not anticipated to be established for Circulating Data Leverage Services, since the Data User activities that are associated with such Services are performed by Data User on its own behalf, not on behalf of a Data Rights Owner (notwithstanding the Data User&rsquo;s obligation to account to Data Rights Owner for revenues generated through its Circulating Data Leverage Services activities).
4.0.3=ESLs are established for the express purpose of creating a threshold of performance for some aspect of the relevant Service for which the ESL is provided.&nbsp; In the event that Data User fails to provide and perform the relevant Service at a level that is equivalent to that called for in a particular ESL, Data Rights Owner can pursue remedies through the Fee Reduction Mechanism provided for in section __ of this Agreement, and other remedies provided for herein.
4.0.4=ESLs are not intended to provide comprehensive &ldquo;specifications&rdquo; for duties-of-care associated with performance of Services by Data Users; this entire Agreement and the Schedules set forth a more comprehensive set of requirements associated with Data User performance hereunder.
4.0.5=Instead, the ESLs are only intended to identify those Service elements for which (i) performance is sufficiently empirically and objectively measurable, and (ii) for which the damages due to harm is the most directly calculable, that ESL performance failures can lend themselves to contractual liquidated damages structures that can be deployed effectively by automated, scalable dispute resolution systems, such as those that support this Agreement.
4.0.6=Thus, only a subset of the rights of Data Rights Owners will lend themselves to treatment under the ESL arrangements of this section 4.&nbsp; It is, however, anticipated that the proportion of Services that lend themselves to ESL treatment will increase over time, as candidate &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; for emerging Data User standards of care are shared, and rules and expected Vault Data and Circulating Data behaviors are normalized and harmonized across jurisdictions and sectors.&nbsp; Any such ESL-market advancement will be documented pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

8.12.Title=Fee Reductions
8.12.1=This Section 8.12 (and Schedule 8.12) specify certain &quot;Fee Reductions.&quot;&nbsp; It is understood that these Fee Reductions are intended to reflect, to some extent, the diminished value of Data User&#39;s Services in certain limited and identified events where system performance does not conform to a relevant ESL.&nbsp; Fee Reductions are intended to incentivize consistent performance by Registered Parties acting as Data Users and to provide an efficient and satisfactory method of compensatory recovery for Data Rights Owners that experience the subset of system performance issues of the types set forth in Schedule __ from time to time.
8.12.2=Fee Reductions are not, however, intended to be the sole method through which a Data Rights Owner can seek compensation for any breach or default by Data User under this Agreement, and such other remedies can also be pursued, provided that any Fee Reduction applied to benefit a Data Rights Owner under this Agreement shall reduce the amount of any damages or other payments subsequently received from Data User to compensate Data Rights Owner for the same incident that led to a Material Default.&nbsp; Fee Reductions are not intended to be liquidated damages, penalties or similar charges.

8.4.1.0.1=A Registered Party acting in its capacity as a Data User may share, transfer, license, exploit, monetize and otherwise use Circulating Data (collectively &ldquo;Circulating Data Actions&rdquo;) freely and without any Data Rights Owner&rsquo;s permission or consent.&nbsp; Registered Parties in their capacities as Data Rights Owners acknowledges and agree that, because Circulating Data is de-identified data, (i) no direct interests of Data Rights Owner in Vault Data are <em>per se </em>negatively affected solely by such Circulating Data Actions, including but not limited to interests in the nature of those protected by misappropriation and other similar equitable &ldquo;unjust enrichment&rdquo; concepts, and (ii) there is no risk of direct identity intrusion harm solely as a result of the making available of or sharing with third parties of such Circulating Data.
8.4.1.0.2=Notwithstanding the acknowledgement in the prior sentence, Registered Parties also recognize that the Data Rights Owner is a source of Circulating Data (alone or in combination with other Data Rights Owners from which Vault Data is made available to Data User).
8.4.1.0.3=Thus, while the Data User may use and transfer Circulating Data in its discretion, it must also account to and compensate the Data Rights Owner for a portion of the value realized by Data User attributable to the Vault Data of each Data Rights Owner from which the Circulating Data was derived.&nbsp; This payment is roughly analogous to that made by an oil refining company to a drilling company (or the owner of a well, etc.) for unrefined crude oil, except that payment obligation of a Data User arises, not upon the creation of such Circulating Data, but upon its subsequent use for monetary value.&nbsp; The Vault Data that is made available by Registered Parties in their respective capacities as Data Rights Owners is the &ldquo;feedstock&rdquo; of the data leverage (multiple users) in the Circulating Data markets. &nbsp;This Agreement is intended to provide a mechanism for Registered Parties to more explicitly experience the benefits and burdens associated with Circulating Data markets, and to participate, through the choices they make in interacting with other Registered Parties as Data Users, in their co-management and design, development and deployment.
8.4.1.0.4=The parties also recognize that de-identified data can be brought together with other data, or can be applied in contexts (or by Registered Parties with subjective prior knowledge) where it can become &ldquo;personal information&rdquo; (and therefore once-again classify as &ldquo;Vault Data&rdquo; under this Agreement) that can &ldquo;inform&rdquo; one or more parties about a Registered Party or other party, as a result of which such data becomes &ldquo;re-identified data&rdquo; (and therefore &ldquo;Vault Data&rdquo;).&nbsp; If and to the extent that any such re-identification event results in the creation of Vault Data, any Registered Party that comes into contact with such Vault Data, whether or not be intention or design, shall have the rights and obligations of a Data User with respect to such Vault Data, which results in the Data Rights Owner automatically receiving &ldquo;Vault Data&rdquo; Service levels of duty of care, automatically upon such re-identification event, without the requirement of further action by Data Rights Owner, all as dealt with elsewhere in this Agreement.

8.8.2=Any such costs will be invoiced by Data User to Data Rights Owner, and shall be payable by Data Rights Owner without any increases, surcharges, service fees, or other additions added as line items to a Data Rights Owner invoice, provided however, that the Data User may recover its operational, administrative and other costs associated with administering such Services through the mechanism of including such costs in the overall overhead costs that are included in its fee calculations for the Services.
