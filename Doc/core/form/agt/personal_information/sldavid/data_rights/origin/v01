0.0=This Standard Data Rights Distributed Management Services Agreement (&quot;Agreement&quot;) is effective as to any [Party] on the date of [Acceptance]of the [Online Registration] of any such Party (the &ldquo;Effective Date&rdquo;)(such party a &ldquo;Registered Party&rdquo;).

0.1=<u>{0.1.Title}</u><br>{0.1.1}<br>{0.1.2}
0.1.Title=Registered Party Rights and Obligations:

0.1.1=From and after the Effective Date, and until the [Termination Date], any Registered Party in [Good Standing] under this Agreement shall enjoy the rights of a &ldquo;Data Rights Owner,&rdquo; and be subject to the obligations and affirmative duties of a &ldquo;Data User&rdquo; as the context requires, all as provided herein.&nbsp;

<p>[DRAFTING NOTE:&nbsp; Consider moving following narrative paragraphs out of the body of the Agreement to the endnotes, or editing the narrative for use with individual-facing version of Agreement and educational materials].&nbsp;

0.1.2=Hence, each Registered Party hereunder will have the status of a &ldquo;Data Rights Owner&rdquo; and &ldquo;Data User&rdquo; under this Agreement, but its rights and duties recognized under this Agreement will vary, as required, from those associated with one or the other status depending upon their roles in a particular [Data Action Event.].&nbsp;References to &ldquo;Data Rights Owner&rdquo; and &ldquo;Data User&rdquo; hereunder are intended to convey such status differences as the context requires, and both terms are used alternately with references to &ldquo;Registered Party&rdquo; as the context requires.

<a href="#_edn6" name="_ednref" title="">[vi]</a> 

0.2=<u>{0.2.Title}</u><br>{0.2.1}<br>{0.2.2}<br>{0.2.3}

0.2.Title=Registered Party in Its Role as Data Rights Owner Enjoys Distributed Data Rights Management Services:
0.2.1=The satisfactory performance by Registered Parties of their various duties under this Agreement in their capacity as Data Users, and their accountability therefor through mechanisms of enforcement under this Agreement (or cross referenced in the schedules hereof), [makes real][gives effect to] the rights of Data Rights Owners under this Agreement, and carries into effect the system of distributed Data Rights Management &ldquo;Services&rdquo; (including the sub-categories of Services set forth in Section 3 hereof).
<a href="#_edn7" name="_ednref" title="">[vii]</a>
0.2.2=These Services are, in turn, enjoyed by Registered Parties in their respective capacities as Data Rights Owners in consideration of their provisional and conditional granting of various specific data rights under this Agreement to other Registered Parties acting as Data Users hereunder in order to secure such satisfactory performance.&nbsp;

0.2.3=The rights and duties hereunder are mutually dependent and are enforceable pursuant to this standard form contract, and each Registered Party is therefore [expected][understood] to assume alternating roles under this Agreement. &nbsp;This Agreement documents an integrated and distributed network of dependencies in which it is in every Registered Party&rsquo;s self interest to perform the duties under the Agreement (in its capacity as both a Data User, and also those duties assigned to Registered Parties as Data Rights Owners) as an integrated legal structure designed to help auto-catalyze otherwise-unattainable security and leverage benefits for Registered Parties acting both as Data Rights Owners and as Data Users under this Agreement.&nbsp;
<a href="#_edn8" name="_ednref" title="">[viii]</a>
<a href="#_edn9" name="_ednref" title="">[ix]</a>

0.3=<u>{0.3.Title}</u><br>{0.3.1}<br>{0.3.2}

0.3.Title=Registered Party in the Role of Data User Enjoys Data Access, Cost Reduction and Risk/Liability Mitigation:

0.3.1=Not only does the satisfactory performance by a Registered Party of its various duties under this Agreement in its role as Data User qualify such Registered User for the protection of their rights as a Data Rights Owner hereunder; it also qualifies such Data User for the rights and benefits provided to Data Users under this Agreement.

0.3.2=Data User rights include, without limitation, (i) enhanced, co-managed access to higher quality Circulating Data and Vault Data under the terms hereof, (ii) various contractual &ldquo;safe harbors&rdquo; described herein, (iii) the benefits of conditional covenants by Registered Parties not to sue other Registered Parties in their respective capacities as Data Users with respect to objectively-testable, Agreement-conformant behavior, and (iv) other standards that can help to reduce the risk and cost to Data Users of interacting with data, and enhance access to valuable Circulating and Vault Data for Registered Parties as Data Users (consistent with and in furtherance of Data Rights Owners enforceable interests), all as provided further in this Agreement.

<a href="#_edn10" name="_ednref" title="">[x]</a>

0.4=<u>{0.4.Title}</u><br>{0.4.1}<br>{0.4.2}<br>{0.4.3}<br>{0.4.4}

0.4.Title=Registered Parties are All Mutually Bound:

0.4.1=Upon Registration Acceptance (which follows the act of Registration for Registered Party [Applications] that meet [Acceptance Criteria], which includes an affirmative agreement to the terms of this Agreement) each Registered Party is bound to all other Registered Parties to this Agreement, and hence into direct contractual &ldquo;privity&rdquo; with every other Registered Party.&nbsp; There are no third party beneficiary rights under the Agreement, which means that only Registered Parties can enjoy the contract rights under this Agreement, and only Registered Parties are bound to its terms.&nbsp;

<a href="#_edn11" name="_ednref" title="">[xi]</a>

0.4.2=To enjoy such rights, a party must agree to be bound to the duties of a Data User [and also the duties of a Data Rights Owner] hereunder, knowing that any and all Registered Parties in the entire population of Registered Parties can enforce this Agreement against any other Registered Party, including them, under the terms of this Agreement and as otherwise provided by applicable law.
<a href="#_edn12" name="_ednref" title="">[xii]</a>

0.4.3=Thus, when a party becomes a Registered Party, it owes duties under this Agreement to take actions relating to Vault Data and Circulating Data pursuant to described duties-of-care which conform to the obligations and responsibilities of a &ldquo;Data User&rdquo; hereunder, and they simultaneously become a beneficiary of the conformant performance by other Registered Parties to those standards-of-care.&nbsp; The conformant performance of such duties gives life to the legal rights of Data Rights Owner hereunder.&nbsp;&nbsp; [The use of a standard form agreement (such as this Agreement) across the entire population of Registered Parties assures that the rights and duties will extend to both bind and benefit all other Registered Parties, even those that a particular Registered Party will never meet in person.

<a href="#_edn13" name="_ednref" title="">[xiii]</a>

0.4.4=In the distributed legal architecture of this Agreement, the standardized, auditable, accountable, enforceable rights and duties connect each Registered Party to every other Registered Party, and create behavioral reliability that is the precursor to formalized, scalable &ldquo;trust&rdquo; among all Registered Parties and every other Registered Party.&nbsp; The system&rsquo;s reliability is built upon the distributed sources of a form of &ldquo;neighborhood watch&rdquo; constructed from the natural attentiveness of the stakeholders (borne of self-interest) regarding their respective rights under this Agreement (whether such rights are characterized as related to fundamental, civil, contractual, statutory, regulatory, or other rights in a given jurisdiction) and their ability to exercise private rights of action under this Agreement to enforce those rights.&nbsp;

<a href="#_edn14" name="_ednref" title="">[xiv]</a>
<a href="#_edn15" name="_ednref" title="">[xv]</a>
<a href="#_edn16" name="_ednref" title="">[xvi]</a>

0.5=<u>{0.5.Title}</u><br>{0.5.1}<br>{0.5.2}

0.5.Title=Supplemental Rights Permitted:

0.5.1=The various rights that are fostered by this Agreement, and are manifested in the Services under section 3, are each intended to deliver real benefit to realize the Data Rights Owners&rsquo; interests in the two general categories of &ldquo;data security/privacy&rdquo; and &ldquo;data leverage.&rdquo; &nbsp;The performance of the bundle of Data User duties by Registered Parties under this Agreement in their respective capacities as Data Users is enjoyed by Data Rights Owners as distributed Data Rights Management Services.

<a href="#_edn17" name="_ednref" title="">[xvii]</a>
<a href="#_edn18" name="_ednref" title="">[xviii]</a>
<a href="#_edn19" name="_ednref" title="">[xix]</a>
0.5.2=All Registered Parties will be equally bound to the obligations and duties set forth in this Agreement, provided that any sub-group of Registered Owners may agree to additional rights and duties that apply only to such sub-group, so long as they are not inconsistent with [(and promote)] those provided under this Agreement.

<a href="#_edn20" name="_ednref" title="">[xx]</a>

0.5.2=Thus, for example, commercial, governmental or civil society entities that institutionalize the provision of some or all of such &ldquo;Supplemental Services&rdquo; hereunder in their role as [Data User Intermediaries], may offer various additional incentives, such as monetary payments and service enhancements, to attract Registered Parties to a particular set of Supplemental Services.&nbsp; In such a case, both Registered Parties will be aware that such Supplemental Services are required to be provided in a manner that is consistent with the Services hereunder, which Services are more broadly recognized beyond any such sub-group of Registered Parties to which such Supplemental Services apply, and which Services reflect the population-cohering behavioral artifact of a basic distributed legal infrastructure, documented in this Agreement, to support the distributed data architecture of the Internet.

<p>[DRAFTING NOTE:&nbsp; End of narrative paragraphs to consider moving to notes]


0.6=For and in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants contained herein, the receipt, sufficiency, and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the Registered Parties, intending to be legally bound, hereby contract and agree as follows:

<a href="#_edn21" name="_ednref" title="">[xxi]</a>

1=<u>{1.Title}</u><br>{1.1}<br>{1.2}<br>{1.3}<br>{1.4}<br>{1.5}


1.Title=Background and Purpose; Agreement Standardizes a Set of Data Usage Duties and Supplements Other Agreements

<a href="#_edn22" name="_ednref" title="">[xxii]</a>
<p>[DRAFTING NOTE:&nbsp; Consider moving the following narrative paragraphs to the notes.]

1.1=This Agreement documents a set of mutually-dependent agreements associated with data-related exchanges and interactions between and among multiple Registered Parties, including both individuals and institutions, each of which is called a &ldquo;Registered Party&rdquo; and each of which alternately acts as a &quot;Data Rights Owner&quot; and [&quot;Data User&quot;][&ldquo;Data Handler&rdquo;] (both as defined below), sometimes in both roles even within a related series of interactions..
<a href="#_edn23" name="_ednref" title="">[xxiii]</a>
<a href="#_edn24" name="_ednref" title="">[xxiv]</a>

1.2=The &ldquo;dual role&rdquo; of every Registered Party provides the incentive, balanced with obligation, that is a stabilizing influence in this data infrastructure for other economic/legal/social architectures upon which co-managed data rights management depends.&nbsp; Under this Agreement structure, to reduce one&rsquo;s own risk, a Registered Party must act in a way to help other Registered Parties to reduce their respective risks.&nbsp; The opportunity of a Party to enjoy the rights provided under this Agreement is conditioned upon their performance of duties under this Agreement.&nbsp; The interdependence of these contractual rights and duties in this document is intended to reflect and make reliable and enforceable their functional mutual interdependence so that data system reliability can be established as a foundation for online &ldquo;trust.&rdquo;

<a href="#_edn25" name="_ednref" title="">[xxv]</a>
<a href="#_edn26" name="_ednref" title="">[xxvi]</a>

1.3=The Agreement structure seeks to create and deploy a distributed legal architecture to serve the needs of stakeholders engaging in data exchanges across data networks that depend upon a distributed data architecture, such as the Internet.&nbsp; Accordingly, under this Agreement, each Registered Party in its role as Data User shall, in consideration for enjoying its rights as Data User as set forth herein, abide by certain conditions and requirements associated with its access to such data (&ldquo;Data User Duties&rdquo;).

1.4=Every Registered Party&rsquo;s&rsquo; fulfillment of its promise to perform the duties assigned to it under this Agreement constitutes the successful &ldquo;recruitment&rdquo; of Registered Parties as Data Users to help achieve Registered Party&rsquo;s goals to enjoy rights (such as &ldquo;privacy&rdquo; and other data integrity rights) as Data Rights Owners.&nbsp; The performance of these standard duties by populations of Registered Parties/Data Users achieves risk and cost reduction at large scale for all Registered Parties, in ways that they cannot achieve unilaterally (and cannot even achieve among existing online data/identity standards consortia), and more effectively provides Data Rights Owner and Data Rights Owner&#39;s Affiliates (if that option is selected by Data Rights Owner) with functional, enforceable, accountable, &ldquo;crowd sourced,&rdquo; data rights management services (and related identity information-technology services) received from any party that comes into possession of Vault Data and Circulating Data in which Data Rights Owner has an interest, all on the terms and conditions set forth below.


<a href="#_edn27" name="_ednref" title="">[xxvii]</a>
<a href="#_edn28" name="_ednref" title="">[xxviii]</a>

1.5=To the extent that either the Data Rights Owner or Data User are, at any time while they are a party to this Agreement, parties to a separate legal agreement (or other legal obligation) through which Data User collects, stores, handles, uses, transfers, processes [other verbs here to cover standard set of &ldquo;Data Actions?&rdquo;] or otherwise has possession or access to data from, relating to or relatable to Data Rights Owner in accordance with that agreement and applicable local law or pursuant to which data about Data Rights Owner is shared with third-parties (whether such sharing is done on behalf of Data Rights Owner or Data User), as the case may be (each an &ldquo;Existing Agreement&rdquo;), the Registered Parties that are also the Parties thereto wish to continue to be bound by such Existing Agreements to define their legal relationships external to those set forth in this Agreement, and to supplement such Existing Agreements with the terms of this Agreement.&nbsp; The Parties mutually acknowledge and agree that the terms of this Agreement are supplemental to those of the Existing Agreement(s), and to the extent of any conflict between the terms of such agreements, the terms of this Agreement replace and supersede the terms and conditions of the Existing Agreements.

2.Title=DEFINITIONS

2.0=The words and phrases set forth in Schedule 2 hereof, when used in this Agreement, shall have the indicated meanings.&nbsp; (Terms capitalized within a particular definition have been defined elsewhere within this Agreement.)

[REVIEW NOTE:&nbsp; Schedule 2 is under development.&nbsp; Various definitions are currently being drafted.&nbsp; Also, we are in the process of working with various folks at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other institutions to harmonize the language of this legal agreement with terminology that is more familiar to technology-oriented system architects.&nbsp; The intention is to use these definitional toe-holds in the Agreement make the legal tools for dealing with system user reliability issues more accessible to technology folks, and vice versa.&nbsp; Until such later time as they are integrated into the Agreement, please ignore those definitions, and the accompanying footnotes, that are highlighted in green, since they are not yet integrated into the text.]

[Drafting Note:&nbsp; Consider inclusion of additional general terms applicable only to Services in this section]

3.7.0.3=Such Services will include, but not be limited to, Data User&rsquo;s obligation to maintain full and complete records and details of all actions taken with respect to all Vault Data and all Circulating Data, and all granting of access permissions and other information necessary to enable the full and complete accounting of all Vault Data AND Circulating Data use.

<p>[DRAFTING NOTE:&nbsp; The following paragraph is an effort to craft a legal description of a persistent data permission architecture that can reliably function for data action accounting, without the necessity of &ldquo;attaching&rdquo; metadata to data, which can be burdensome on system resources.&nbsp; The accounting meta data is external to the core data stream and is like a meter on a valve on a pipe.]&nbsp; Such records and details will be maintained in a manner that has the effect of virtually, but provably, &ldquo;attaching&rdquo; the metadata to all Vault Data used or transferred, not with an actual physical or file based joining of such data and meta data, but rather through the maintenance of a data and information system that permits the persistent, non-destructible maintenance of the metadata information in any manner that permits the verifiably accurate reconstruction of such metadata by the Data Users, the Data Rights Owner and any other party authorized to have access to such data under contract or public law. [Drafting Note:&nbsp; Consider inclusion of additional general terms applicable only to Services in this section]

4.Title=Expected Service Levels (&ldquo;ESLs&rdquo;)

<a href="#_edn49" name="_ednref" title="">[xlix]</a>

4.0.1=ESLs may be established for one or more of the following categories of services:

4.0.1.1=Data Acquisition and Collection Services,

4.0.1.2=Vault Data Warehousing and Data Integrity Services,

4.0.1.3=Vault Data Sharing Services

4.0.1.4=Data Portability Services

4.0.1.5=Vault Data Unauthorized Access Recovery Services

4.0.1.6=Other Services made available by Data User to Data Rights owner from time to time.

4.0.2=ESLs are not anticipated to be established for Circulating Data Leverage Services, since the Data User activities that are associated with such Services are performed by Data User on its own behalf, not on behalf of a Data Rights Owner (notwithstanding the Data User&rsquo;s obligation to account to Data Rights Owner for revenues generated through its Circulating Data Leverage Services activities).

<a href="#_edn50" name="_ednref" title="">[l]</a>

4.0.3=ESLs are established for the express purpose of creating a threshold of performance for some aspect of the relevant Service for which the ESL is provided.&nbsp; In the event that Data User fails to provide and perform the relevant Service at a level that is equivalent to that called for in a particular ESL, Data Rights Owner can pursue remedies through the Fee Reduction Mechanism provided for in section __ of this Agreement, and other remedies provided for herein.

<a href="#_edn51" name="_ednref" title="">[li]</a>

4.0.4=ESLs are not intended to provide comprehensive &ldquo;specifications&rdquo; for duties-of-care associated with performance of Services by Data Users; this entire Agreement and the Schedules set forth a more comprehensive set of requirements associated with Data User performance hereunder.

4.0.5=Instead, the ESLs are only intended to identify those Service elements for which (i) performance is sufficiently empirically and objectively measurable, and (ii) for which the damages due to harm is the most directly calculable, that ESL performance failures can lend themselves to contractual liquidated damages structures that can be deployed effectively by automated, scalable dispute resolution systems, such as those that support this Agreement.

4.0.6=Thus, only a subset of the rights of Data Rights Owners will lend themselves to treatment under the ESL arrangements of this section 4.&nbsp; It is, however, anticipated that the proportion of Services that lend themselves to ESL treatment will increase over time, as candidate &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; for emerging Data User standards of care are shared, and rules and expected Vault Data and Circulating Data behaviors are normalized and harmonized across jurisdictions and sectors.&nbsp; Any such ESL-market advancement will be documented pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.


4.1=<u>{4.1.Title}</u><br>{4.1.0}

4.1.Title=Specification of ESLs

4.1.0=All ESL&rsquo;s shall be performed as specified in the ESL section of the relevant Service schedule for that Service identified in section 3 as amended from time to time.


4.2=<u>{4.2.Title}</u><ol><li>{4.2.1}</li><li>{4.2.2}</li></ol>

4.2.Title=ESL Measurement and Reporting; Accounting

4.2.1=Data User shall make available to Data Rights Owners reports and statistics regarding its performance of the various Services with respect to any Vault Data and Circulating Data for any other Registered Parties in their respective capacities as Data Rights Owners against the ESLs during each calendar month, by the fifteenth (15th) business day of the following month.

<a href="#_edn52" name="_ednref" title="">[lii]</a>
<a href="#_edn53" name="_ednref" title="">[liii]</a>

4.2.2=Measurements of system availability that are included in the reports under this Agreement shall exclude (i) scheduled downtime, (ii) delays in the provision of a Service schedule requested by or caused by Data Rights Owner, and (iii) unscheduled downtime to the extent attributable to (x) Force Majeure Events, or (y) the acts or omissions of Data Rights Owner or its employees, agents, third-party contractors, and suppliers.

8.3.1.1=Nature of Services:&nbsp; As provided in section 3, Data Users may not share Vault Data with any third party without Data Rights Owner&rsquo;s permission.&nbsp; That permission may be granted by Data Rights Owners: (i) on a per-sharing-event basis, (ii) by reference to categories of data, (iii) by identification of limited sets of permitted Observer Users, or (iv) any other method agreed upon by the Data User and the Data Rights Owner from time to time under this Agreement that reflects, carries forward and helps make viable Data Rights Owner co-management of Vault Data under this Agreement.

8.3.1.2=Data Users may only share Vault Data in a manner that reflects and carries into effect the rights of Data Rights Owner, [acting in a capacity as a data version of a &ldquo;data agent&rdquo; pursuant to the Agency Terms set forth under section 3.___] with respect to any such third party use.&nbsp; In all sharing activities involving Vault Data, and in recognition of Data Rights Owner&rsquo;s primacy in determining the use and disposition of Vault Data, the Data User will act in a way that is consistent with the interests of Data Rights Owner under this Agreement and is in the best interests of the Data Rights Owner when engaging in any Vault Data Sharing Services.

8.3.2=Fees: &nbsp;Data User[, acting in capacity as agent for Data Rights Owner pursuant to the Agency Terms set forth under section 3.____,] shall generate and earn a &ldquo;Shared Vault Data Commission&rdquo; from providing Vault Data Sharing Services.&nbsp; The commission shall be calculated in the manner provided in Schedule 8.3 (b).

8.4.1.Title=Nature of Services

8.4.1.0.1=A Registered Party acting in its capacity as a Data User may share, transfer, license, exploit, monetize and otherwise use Circulating Data (collectively &ldquo;Circulating Data Actions&rdquo;) freely and without any Data Rights Owner&rsquo;s permission or consent.&nbsp; Registered Parties in their capacities as Data Rights Owners acknowledges and agree that, because Circulating Data is de-identified data, (i) no direct interests of Data Rights Owner in Vault Data are <em>per se </em>negatively affected solely by such Circulating Data Actions, including but not limited to interests in the nature of those protected by misappropriation and other similar equitable &ldquo;unjust enrichment&rdquo; concepts, and (ii) there is no risk of direct identity intrusion harm solely as a result of the making available of or sharing with third parties of such Circulating Data.

<a href="#_edn72" name="_ednref" title="">[lxxii]</a>

8.4.1.0.2=Notwithstanding the acknowledgement in the prior sentence, Registered Parties also recognize that the Data Rights Owner is a source of Circulating Data (alone or in combination with other Data Rights Owners from which Vault Data is made available to Data User).

8.4.1.0.3=Thus, while the Data User may use and transfer Circulating Data in its discretion, it must also account to and compensate the Data Rights Owner for a portion of the value realized by Data User attributable to the Vault Data of each Data Rights Owner from which the Circulating Data was derived.&nbsp; This payment is roughly analogous to that made by an oil refining company to a drilling company (or the owner of a well, etc.) for unrefined crude oil, except that payment obligation of a Data User arises, not upon the creation of such Circulating Data, but upon its subsequent use for monetary value.&nbsp; The Vault Data that is made available by Registered Parties in their respective capacities as Data Rights Owners is the &ldquo;feedstock&rdquo; of the data leverage (multiple users) in the Circulating Data markets. &nbsp;This Agreement is intended to provide a mechanism for Registered Parties to more explicitly experience the benefits and burdens associated with Circulating Data markets, and to participate, through the choices they make in interacting with other Registered Parties as Data Users, in their co-management and design, development and deployment.

<a href="#_edn73" name="_ednref" title="">[lxxiii]</a>

8.4.1.0.4=The parties also recognize that de-identified data can be brought together with other data, or can be applied in contexts (or by Registered Parties with subjective prior knowledge) where it can become &ldquo;personal information&rdquo; (and therefore once-again classify as &ldquo;Vault Data&rdquo; under this Agreement) that can &ldquo;inform&rdquo; one or more parties about a Registered Party or other party, as a result of which such data becomes &ldquo;re-identified data&rdquo; (and therefore &ldquo;Vault Data&rdquo;).&nbsp; If and to the extent that any such re-identification event results in the creation of Vault Data, any Registered Party that comes into contact with such Vault Data, whether or not be intention or design, shall have the rights and obligations of a Data User with respect to such Vault Data, which results in the Data Rights Owner automatically receiving &ldquo;Vault Data&rdquo; Service levels of duty of care, automatically upon such re-identification event, without the requirement of further action by Data Rights Owner, all as dealt with elsewhere in this Agreement.

8.10.2=To the extent Data User is required under applicable law to collect and remit any Data Rights Owner Tax to the relevant taxing authority, Data User shall invoice Data Rights Owner the amount of such tax, as a separate line item, and Data Rights Owner will pay such tax as part of such invoice.

8.10.3=Data Rights Owner shall have the right, in its sole discretion and at its cost, to contest the validity of the imposition of any Data Rights Owner Tax.

8.12.2=Fee Reductions are not, however, intended to be the sole method through which a Data Rights Owner can seek compensation for any breach or default by Data User under this Agreement, and such other remedies can also be pursued, provided that any Fee Reduction applied to benefit a Data Rights Owner under this Agreement shall reduce the amount of any damages or other payments subsequently received from Data User to compensate Data Rights Owner for the same incident that led to a Material Default.&nbsp; Fee Reductions are not intended to be liquidated damages, penalties or similar charges.

8.12.3=Fee Reductions will not be imposed in the event the ESL System performance issue is attributable primarily to: (i) an act or omission of Data Rights Owner; (ii) a Force Majeure event; or (iii) changes in technology equipment or architectures that are implemented by Data Rights Owner without the prior approval of Data User.

<p>SCHEDULE 3.4</p>

<p>Vault Data Sharing Services (including various identity management and attribute-related services, credentialing services, etc. (see Section 3.4 and Schedule 3.4)</p>

<p>[To Come &ndash; See notes accompanying Section 3.4.]</p>

<p>[Requirements include:</p>

<p>Any transfer or use of any Vault Data as Vault Data by Data User (other than the creation of Circulating Data) is subject to Data Rights Owner notice and consent.</p>

<p>Commission is earned by Data User from revenues associated with permissioned Vault Data use.</p>

<p>Other than commission earned by Data User (which is anticipated to be funded by third party payments for access/use of Vault Data), the Data User makes no charge for this Service to Data Rights Owner.]</p>

<p>SCHEDULE 3.5</p>

<p>Circulating Data Leverage Services (see Section 3.5 and Schedule 3.5)</p>

<p>[To Come &ndash; See notes accompanying Section 3.5.]</p>

<p>[Requirements include:</p>

<p>NOTE:&nbsp; Unlike Vault Data related Services, this &ldquo;Service&rdquo; activity is engaged in by Data User on its own behalf &ndash; like a bank engaged in lending money based on fractional reserve lending based on its &ldquo;vault cash&rdquo; calculated with reference to its receipts from depository accounts.]</p>

<p>Data User is required to &ldquo;de-identify&rdquo; Data to a certain level of safety (entropy) based on objectively testable processes and protocols turning Vault Data into Circulating Data.&nbsp; The establishment of objectively testable criteria for de-identification enables audit, etc. and provides sufficient process certainty to justify the provision of contractual &ldquo;safe harbor&rdquo; protection for Data Users that abide by and conform to such processes and protocols.</p>

<p>Data User can share Circulating Data (but not Vault Data) with third parties without Data Rights Owner&rsquo;s permission.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Data User generates revenues from use of Circulating Data.&nbsp; Circulating Data feeds &ldquo;big data&rdquo; applications to generate value.</p>

<p>A portion of the revenue from Circulating Data is used to offset the Data Rights Owner charges, if any, (for example in the case of commercial, institutional Data Users, for Warehousing and Protection services for Vault Data.</p>

<p>A small portion of Circulating Data revenues is paid into a pool among Data Users that funds their creation of a collective &ldquo;reserve&rdquo; account to pay &ldquo;liquidated damages&rdquo; to Data Rights Owners that experience specific, scheduled system harms as a result of the failure of a Data User to achieve an ESL (or other contractual setting) for which specific compensation amounts (in the nature of contractual liquidated damages have been established.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Use of a collective reserve among Data Users creates B2B &ldquo;peer pressure&rdquo; for individual Data Users to conform to Data User performance standards, since every time the collective reserve is tapped into to pay claims, all Data Users need to pay more into the reserve.&nbsp; This will cause the Data Users that are performing consistent with the Agreement to subsidize the poor performers, which will, in turn, motivate the better performing Data Users to self-police the community of Data User.&nbsp; This is a similar approach taken in the context of various global fisheries, where self-policing structures also rely on the compulsion of economics of diminishments of &ldquo;pooled by-catch quotas,&rdquo; rather than on the compulsion of sovereign laws.&nbsp; It is arguable that where the structure is intended to bridge multiple jurisdictions, a form of economic compulsion is more scalable.</p>

<p>It is possible that commercial, institutional Data Users will generate revenue to result in net income sufficient so that they can make a profit and share any excess with Data Rights Owners.&nbsp; This is a potential competitive differentiator among Data Users that are willing to embrace the needs of Data Rights Owners to improve their online &ldquo;identity integrity.&rdquo;&nbsp; Data Rights Owners will likely prefer to interact (commercially, socially, etc.) with Data Users that offer a combination of more security, privacy and a greater &ldquo;return&rdquo; on data leverage to Data Rights Owners.&nbsp; Even socially, people tend to prefer relationships with people who they can &ldquo;trust&rdquo; to be discreet with the information that they share.&nbsp; And who respect the boundaries of acceptable use of data.&nbsp; (See, for example, Helen Nissenbaum&rsquo;s concepts of &ldquo;contextual integrity&rdquo; and &ldquo;distribution norms&rdquo; here).&nbsp; This package of Services will potentially attract more Data Rights Owners to that Data User, yielding more Vault Data, which in turn has can generate more Circulating Data, which in turn generates more data leverage.</p>

<p>Data Users that perform &ldquo;de-identification&rdquo; of Vault Data (to derive Circulating Data) in conformity to objectively testable, agreed upon standards will be given &ldquo;safe harbor&rdquo; treatment (by operation of the agreement, not statute or regulation) against a class of legal claims identified in the Agreement.&nbsp; This contractual &ldquo;safe harbor&rdquo; is a benefit that provides some of the cost certainty needed to make data leverage service provision attractive to potential Data User candidates.&nbsp; The &ldquo;safe harbor&rdquo; is part of the package of contract &ldquo;consideration&rdquo; provided to help incentivize system-supporting behavior that conforms to Data User duties under the Agreement.]</p>

<p><strong>SCHEDULE 21</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dispute Resolution</strong></p>

<p>[To Come]</p>

<p>[Note that Dispute resolution is intended to be automated in order to enable scaled solutions for large volumes of small transactions and interactions that will take place with respect to both Vault Data and Circulating Data.</p>

<p>Also, we are currently engaging in research into alternative forms of alternative dispute resolution.&nbsp; Specifically, it is recognized that only a subset of Internet users will ever encounter &ldquo;western style&rdquo; dispute resolution processes, and that as smart phone and other hardware interfaces to hyper-connected data networks become more ubiquitous (for example through the billions of deployed smartphones worldwide), the proportion of Data Rights Owners using the systems that are familiar with more traditional (&ldquo;non-western&rdquo;) forms of dispute resolution will increase.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Specifically, we are exploring the shared characteristics of more &ldquo;indigenous&rdquo; forms of dispute resolution for candidate structures that can be deployed to expedite dispute resolution for massively distributed legal structures such as that contemplated by this Agreement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To date, several characteristics have been identified that are informing dispute resolution structures for this Agreement.&nbsp; This includes (i) the emphasis on &ldquo;compensatory&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;punitive&rdquo; measures of damages calculations as remedies (manifested in the ESL and &ldquo;liquidated damages&rdquo; elements of the Agreement), (ii) enablement of opportunity for an aggrieved party to &ldquo;tell their story&rdquo; (use of transparent accounting and &ldquo;peer reputation system) and (iii) use of elders and experts to deliberate on matters (self-regulatory processes for disputes that are not within ESL&rsquo;s, and are characteristic of a particular sub-community of Registered Parties (such as within an industry, within a country, etc.).</p>

<p>For example, item (i), the reliance on compensatory structures, helped to inform the mechanism for creating a &ldquo;reserve&rdquo; to fund &ldquo;liquidated damages&rdquo; for violations of objectively testable ESLs (expected service levels) is one facet of the proposed automation.&nbsp; The basis for this approach also reflects the fact that it is likely that system disputes will cluster around certain themes that will occur repeatedly.&nbsp; That repetition will generate history of the cost of response and compensation that will enable the accurate prediction of an amount that would constitute a fair settlement for such a common system problem.&nbsp; As that claims experience accumulates, and minor system problems become automatically compensated through a sort of &ldquo;no fault&rdquo; system covering minor and common problems, those aspects of dispute resolution start to become &ldquo;product features&rdquo; since they are easier to use than services where minor problems must be handled piecemeal.</p>

<p>For those disputes that are outside of the ESL/liquidated damages structure, a modified form of &ldquo;escalation&rdquo; procedure should be considered that can accommodate various forms of mediation, arbitration and, in extreme cases, litigation in an integrated fashion, while still accommodating local jurisdictional (i.e., legal) or sectorial (i.e., industry practice) processes at each stage.</p>

<div>&nbsp;
<div id="edn">
<p> This draft contract has a quite unusual form in that the traditional two &ldquo;counterparties&rdquo; to a bilateral agreement are replaced by a single class of Registered Party, but with each such Registered Party alternatively adopting one of two roles under the Agreement, i.e., in some contexts a &ldquo;Data Rights Owner&rdquo; and in other cases a &ldquo;Data Owner.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Registered Party self-binding to the Agreement is encouraged by the conflation of self interests with empathy in the dual role assumed by each Registered Party.&nbsp; The benefits (rights) come with burdens (duties).&nbsp; This is ultimately an unremarkable proposition, (it is well known that &ldquo;there is no such thing as a free lunch&rdquo;), but made explicit in this Agreement.</p>
<a href="#_ednref" name="_edn1" title="">[i]</a>
<p>The reason for this explication of the dual role in the form of a contract, is that it makes &ldquo;visible&rdquo; the precise nature of a &ldquo;distributed legal architecture.&rdquo;&nbsp; This Agreement is intended to create a framework for a distributed legal architecture to match the distributed architecture of the Internet and its hosted data flows.&nbsp; (See Paul Baran &ldquo;On Distributed Communications&rdquo; Introduction to Distributed Communication Networks&rdquo; 1964 RAND Corporation paper comparing &ldquo;centralized,&rdquo; &ldquo;decentralized,&rdquo; and &ldquo;distributed&rdquo; network architectures &ndash; as part of pre-DARPA design work for the Internet).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Centralized and decentralized data architectures that are traditionally applied as (i) the monitoring, management and control functions of commercial operations (e.g., a focus of Sarbanes Oxley) and (ii) the accountability and logistics functions of governmental operations, and (iii), are applied to effectuate and enforce all (nearly all?) current hierarchical forms of commercial, political, and social governance, do not align with &ldquo;distributed&rdquo; data architectures (aka the &ldquo;Internet&rdquo;) over which an increasing percentage of valuable interactions and transactions are being effected.&nbsp; We need distributed legal architectures to (self) govern distributed data systems.&nbsp; The technology of the Internet is enabling alternative (distributed) data flows challenging the institutional constructs (and their centralize and de-centralized data flows) anticipated in the Peace of Westphalia and other similar governance regimes.</p>

<p>This Agreement is a proposed draft candidate legal framework for one such piece of a distributed legal architecture.&nbsp; This draft Agreement seeks to integrate a variety of legal structuring and drafting solutions for a variety of economic/risk components currently presenting themselves for different stakeholders&rsquo; consideration in emerging data/identity contexts (see work on mutual dependency models for autocatalytic systems).&nbsp; The legal structuring/drafting solutions are derived from various other integrated legal contexts that will be quite familiar to those in law and policy, and together are intended to help visualize an integrated legal solution to ground such a distributed legal architecture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, there is a long tradition in every jurisdiction of reliance on distributed legal architectures, even though they are infrequently described as such.&nbsp; Consider, for example, that civil law suits in the U.S. securities law context makes every stakeholder a &ldquo;policeman.&rdquo;&nbsp; In fact, systems that employ civil versus criminal liability for a subset of their enforcement paradigm (and the enforcement reality that goes with it &ndash; such as the creation of private rights of action, etc.) are examples of distributed legal structures.&nbsp; The two systems are not mutually exclusive (note that securities actions can be elevated to FINRA (the private self regulatory organization guiding U.S. broker-dealer activity) and even to the Securities and Exchange Commission (public, administrative actions) and the U.S. federal courts (judicial actions).&nbsp; The U.S. NSTIC initiative could employ a similar hybrid enforcement paradigm for enforcement of conformity to its future Trustmark scheme to be developed by the private SRO called the IDESG; with enforcement being suggested by some to bump over from the SRO to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and its promises-made-must-be-kept form of enforcement policy under its Article 5 jurisdiction.&nbsp; The promise to be kept is promise to conform to the standards that earned the identity ecosystem trustmark.&nbsp; Other initiatives could follow similar paths.&nbsp; This Agreement is intended to help provide an accounting structure for the Services.&nbsp; To the extent that a trustmark&rsquo;s requirements include duties that are akin to those associated with the Services, this Agreement could be helpfully normatively cross-referenced in such Trustmark (certification mark) arrangement.&nbsp; Multiple normative cross references to this Agreement by multiple different Trustmark schemes would be a source of legal interoperability across regimes, establishing the legal bridges needed to enable safe, privacy enhancing, secure data flows across currently siloed regimes.&nbsp; The Agreement provides an additional legal &ldquo;dimension&rdquo; to offer additional solutions.</p>

<p>[RESEARCH NOTE:&nbsp; Potential interdisciplinary research opportunity relating to Maxwell (electro-magnetic fields) and Calabri Yau space (string theory) as examples of adding dimensions to solve problems; which may be similar when each system (including data/information systems) is considered mathematically AND thermodynamically.&nbsp; See also derivatives market as new &ldquo;dimension&rdquo; to solve risk problems in financial markets; and the challenges of measurement (globally iterated in the financial result of 2008) when such solutions occupy such new &ldquo;dimensions&rdquo; that are not yet &ldquo;risk mapped&rdquo; by new metrics, and unleash new challenges (each of which represents an iteration of system entropy pulsing through the system.&nbsp; See, 30 year entropic periodicity of financial crises in U.S. and U.K. since 1800.&nbsp; Consider also research question of Godel&rsquo;s incompleteness theorem and debates with Whitehead on dimensional challenges in context of knowledge; consider issues raised by Godel in context of data security and questions of risk from system &ldquo;externality&rdquo; in context of hyper-connected information systems (aka the Internet) where there is no viable externality.&nbsp; Incorporate discussion of strategies of biological system resiliency article from NATURE (including not just resistance and avoidance (which pre-suppose an externality and are to that extent self-defeating when no externality exists), but also tolerance, accommodation, incorporation, etc.) &ndash; END OF RESEARCH NOTE]</p>

<p>The various private rights of action upon which intellectual property law depends provide another example of a distributed legal system.&nbsp; In fact, the legal concept of &ldquo;property&rdquo; itself (see Blackstone references, etc.) is an example of a distributed legal system (See book by Jedidiah Purdy, &ldquo;Property and the Legal Imagination [check reference], Yale University Press 2011).&nbsp; Intellectual property law layers on additional abstractions atop the legal imagination of property law to create a structure for dealing with the intangible value components of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret.&nbsp; IP law&rsquo;s scaling challenges have to do with the characterization of the rights in copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret as a form of &ldquo;property,&rdquo; which necessitates <em>post hoc</em> enabling structures like ASCAP/BMI (in copyright) and patent pools (in patent) to achieve scale.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This Agreement takes a different approach (in an effort to anticipate the scaling challenges in advance), not treating data as &ldquo;property&rdquo; per se, but instead treating data as a co-managed resource in recognition of its ubiquity, duplicability, non-rivalrousness, and value of use in context as &ldquo;information.&rdquo;&nbsp; Just as IP law is the &ldquo;container&rdquo; that defines the &ldquo;bundle of rights&rdquo; of IP (like a plastic item formed in a metal mold), so too is this form of contract intended as the &ldquo;container&rdquo; to define the Data Rights Owner&rsquo;s rights associated with data security and leverage.&nbsp; Those rights cannot be realized without the &ldquo;container&rdquo; of a broadly adopted (and thereby standardized) corresponding set of enforceable duties.&nbsp; Broad dependency breeds standardization, and broad standardization breeds dependency.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To many people, the seeming solidity of the concepts of &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; and &ldquo;property&rdquo; appear to be a natural fit with data that can be used to create personal information (which is both potentially intrusive, harmful and valuable).&nbsp; In the physical world, ownership and property are correlated with control and security, which in turn is typically inversely related to the degree of risk exposure.&nbsp; (Note, e.g., that it is &ldquo;property&rdquo; that is pledged as &ldquo;security&rdquo; for a loan.)&nbsp; Maximum control in the physical world is frequently associated with ownership and/or control of property.&nbsp; That is the reason for the controversy between the &ldquo;metalists&rdquo; that desired to have currency backed up by gold or silver; which ended in 1971when the link of currency to metal was ended during the Nixon administration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That desire for control in the digital world Casual references to &ldquo;my data,&rdquo; &ldquo;data as a new asset&rdquo; and similar references capture this notion.&nbsp; The metaphors for future distributed legal systems must be carefully chosen, in anticipation of the nature of the particular networks involved.&nbsp; A full treatment of this issue is beyond the scope of this footnote, but reference Shannon, Von Neuman and MIT Kerberos presentation here.</p>

<p>Recognizing the broad, shared interest in &ldquo;owning&rdquo; something as a perceived strategy for risk reduction, and also in recognition of the several jurisdictions that formally characterize individual personal data and/or information interests alternatively as some combination of property and/or fundamental rights, and understanding that we are dealing with intangibles in any event, this Agreement defines various contractual data &ldquo;rights&rdquo; as the property interests to be &ldquo;owned&rdquo; (hence the term &ldquo;Data Rights Owner.&rdquo;) .&nbsp; Attorneys recognize ownership of &ldquo;rights&rdquo; as common, but the concept may be less familiar to non-attorneys.</p>

<p>This sentence is a placeholder for the discussion of data as a co-managed resource.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is much to discuss here.&nbsp; Reference that the Data Rights Owner is akin a farmer in the U.S., who owns water &ldquo;rights&rdquo; but not the water itself.&nbsp; The farmer does, however, own the crops that it grows with the water.&nbsp; Compare data rights and the &ldquo;information&rdquo; that is created with data.</p>

<p>When Data is conceptually separated from &ldquo;information&rdquo; under Shannon&rsquo;s &ldquo;quantitative theory of information,&rdquo; then data is <u>very roughly</u> akin to the water and valuable &ldquo;information&rdquo; is akin to the crops.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shannon&rsquo;s work provided that data plus meaning equals information.&nbsp; That &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; is brought to data by an observer.&nbsp; That observer is the &ldquo;Data User&rdquo; in this Agreement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Data lawyers will learn to love Shannon, since the act of observation/use of the data (the point at which it &ldquo;informs&rdquo; the person, and therefore becomes valuable &ldquo;information) is the value realization event for data; an event with legal implications.&nbsp; It is also setting for multiple leverage events as well, if multiple Data Users are provided access to and benefit from a single instance of data.&nbsp; It is at the point of use of data to provide valuable information in context at which lawyers can establish structures (such as this Agreement) that will query and test the Data User as to their intention regarding such data use, i.e., are they the Data Rights Owner&rsquo;s doctor, banker, father, lawyer, data thief, etc.&nbsp; The structures can thereby assign appropriate legal duties of care based on the various roles.&nbsp; This Agreement is intended to provide a legal structure that applies those duties in context.</p>

<p>Because the technical aspects of providing access to data recognize that &ldquo;use&rdquo; event as well, it is possible to create technical/legal hybrid &ldquo;valves&rdquo; to control data flow at those value creation events.&nbsp; It is at that time that Data Users are motivated to realize the information value of data access, and so are willing to self-bind to appropriate duties in order to achieve that access.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The &ldquo;negotiation&rdquo; will be standardized (for instance in this form of Agreement) for purposes of scaling, and in recognition of the mutual dependency that underlies the relationship of Data User and Data Rights Owner (See reference to &ldquo;Beyond Mechanism&rdquo; book (MIT Press 2013?) which notes that complexity theorists suggest that standards characterize relationships of dependency &ndash; hence, the example is given that there are very standardized ways to be conceived and born within a given species, but myriad ways to stop living).</p>

<div id="edn">
<p><a href="#_ednref" name="_edn2" title="">[ii]</a> Note that the Agreement is characterized as a &ldquo;Service Agreement&rdquo; for several reasons. First, it is familiar, and it makes the contract structure simple.&nbsp; Second, it accommodates variation (through the Schedules) for localization of systems to better integrate with the existing laws of multiple jurisdictions and multiple sectors (i.e., healthcare, banking, etc.).&nbsp; Third, it helps provide efficacy to individuals, by creating a service paradigm that perpetuates the familiar (but insidiously rights-corroding in its current iteration) characterization of people as &ldquo;consumers&rdquo; in the data context.&nbsp; This Agreement establishes a new consumptive paradigm that is rights-enhancing rather than rights-corroding.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Under this Agreement, each Registered Party that is an individual remains a &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; of a Service, (rather than being a consumer of a separate online good or service, where the data collection and handling apparatus is simply an afterthought to the primary commercial or governmental transaction) which may help to provide such individuals with additional protection under consumer protection and similar laws, as well as preserving, in the U.S., FTC auspices under its Article 5 jurisdiction to help protect individual interests in the U.S.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Service structure is also unique in that it is two-sided, since all Registered Parties play dual roles as Data Rights Owners and Data Users.&nbsp; In essence, each party is both a provider and a receiver of data management services.&nbsp; This may seem odd at first, but it is the result of the characterization of the shared duties under this Agreement as &ldquo;Services.&rdquo;&nbsp; This shared benefits/burdens approach creates a mutual dependency that is also consistent with each Registered Party&rsquo;s self-interest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, the broad mutual dependency of Registered Parties can more readily morph into a structure that more directly recognizes people as data co-managers, and more fundamentally, acknowledges their role as data &ldquo;producers&rdquo; in the &ldquo;production&rdquo; of the valuable information that is realized later on in the various data supply chains that rely on &ldquo;personal data&rdquo; as feed stock.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[iii] &ldquo;Party&rdquo; can be individual, legal entity, etc., but it must be something that has legal capacity to contract.&nbsp; The acts of children (and others who are legally &ldquo;incompetent&rdquo; to contract) and others who do not otherwise have legal capacity to contract, but who do act as Data Users/Data Handlers, are the responsibility of their parents or guardians as provided under local law.&nbsp; For the Agreement to be enforceable in a way that enhances individual data rights, its terms must be able to be applied with certainty against each Registered Party acting as a Data User, otherwise the Data Rights Owners rights under the agreement are illusory.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[iv] Note:&nbsp; Brackets around capitalized terms indicate defined terms the definitions of which will be set forth in the definitions schedule.&nbsp; Some terms are defined in the balance of the Agreement text.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[v] The concept of the Agreement is to create a system of accounting for data use, wherever that data is located (like eBay &ldquo;inventory&rdquo;).&nbsp; It achieves this through &ldquo;recruitment&rdquo; of Data Users to perform various system accounting functions for the system.&nbsp; This accounting is a necessary prerequisite to both the protection of stakeholder rights (such as various privacy rights) and monetization of data leverage strategies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Agreement creates this system of accounting through a form of &ldquo;nectar-based&rdquo; governance, i.e., it provides mutual benefits to stakeholders to attract them to participate in the system and then recruit them to take on various duties (the &ldquo;Services&rsquo;) that make the data accounting system possible.&nbsp; This is necessary since each Registered Party needs to act in a way that is consistent with data system standards in order for the data rights of Data Rights Holders to have real meaning and benefit. Words on paper, without more, do not equate to rights.</p>

<p>Each stakeholder &ldquo;Registered Party&rdquo; has both rights and obligations in the system.&nbsp; The engine for system self-assembly is powered by creating incentives for all relevant stakeholders so that they are each willing to self-bind to the standard duties that are necessary for the system to function.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From a network architecture perspective, each &ldquo;node&rdquo; of the distributed network (i.e., each Registered Party acting as a Data User) must be incentivized to behave in a standard fashion to achieve standard rights and duties across the system.&nbsp; This Agreement seeks to establish an enforceable structure for such incentives that can apply (via contract) across jurisdictions.</p>

<p>This recruitment of stakeholders to help support the system is, in effect, what eBay&rsquo;s system does in order to create supply chains and markets that are sufficiently scalable to turn the previously-low-value junk in people&rsquo;s garages into valuable &ldquo;accountable inventory.&rdquo;&nbsp; eBay did this with a contract and a UI (user interface) that together created standardized terms and processes that, when agreed to by stakeholders, result in the adoption across populations of uniform self-imposed duties for stakeholders, which in turn enables a new form of loosely-coupled supply chain with enough information leverage to render economical those transactions that were previously limited to only local &ldquo;yard sale&rdquo; scaling.&nbsp;</p>

<p>eBay is a commercial business the recruitment strategy of which was engaged in purely for economic purposes.&nbsp; There is no reason, however, that the duties to which stakeholders bind themselves in other similar systems cannot also support various other rights such as rights (even fundamental rights) to privacy, security, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rights are a practical nullity without standards-of-care for the performance of duties consistent with their realization. &nbsp;In those jurisdictions where the duties established by this Agreement are not imposed by legislation, directive or regulation, the Agreement helps to create a structure and process to enable the distributed, online agreement to the standard form contract, and a central repository of the most up-to-date agreement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just as the I.S.D.A 1985 standard interest rate SWAPs form created a standardized and authoritative form, the revision of which is maintained by one entity so that there is consistency of terms across market, this Agreement anticipates a central &ldquo;Online Registration&rdquo; and Acceptance process to cultivate process centralization.&nbsp; The term &ldquo;Online Registration&rdquo; is defined in the Agreement in anticipation of the design of that Online Registration process.&nbsp; Regarding substantive centralization, note that the revision processes for this Agreement are anticipated to be &ldquo;crowd sourced,&rdquo; but the governance structure for such revision will still manifest a single form of master service agreement (with schedules providing the contractual &ldquo;flexibility&rdquo; to accommodate jurisdictional, sectorial and jurisdictional variation), that will be presented in the Online Registration Process.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[vi] For example, when Vault Data (or Circulating Data derived therefrom) of the Registered Party is involved, that Registered Party will enjoy the rights and protections of a Data Rights Owner under this Agreement, but if that same Registered Party comes into possession of Vault Data relating to another Registered Party, its relationship to that data is that of a Data User under this Agreement, along with the duties and obligations associated therewith.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[vii] The Services might be said to collectively constitute &ldquo;Privacy as a Service.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[viii] As a result, a contractual metric of &ldquo;empathy&rdquo; is established, based on a concept &ldquo;mutual altruism,&rdquo; where self-interest is deferred with the expectation of indirect return, and the satisfaction of those expectations can be measured (and inform future actions in a market).</p>

</div>

<div id="edn">
<p><a href="#_ednref" name="_edn9" title="">[ix]</a>&nbsp; Normalized interaction settings become standardized as dependency grows across populations.&nbsp; These settings are referred to as &ldquo;markets&rdquo; in the commercial context, and as &ldquo;communities&rdquo; in social spheres; and it is in these settings where adoption of these common Agreement terms over large populations or Registered Parties can significantly enhance the security and leverage benefits, which then generate valuable legal &ldquo;network effects&rdquo; of the interoperable, distributed legal system which results from such adoption.[ix]&nbsp;</p>

<p>This Agreement seeks to help establish such a virtual &ldquo;Data Agora&rdquo; where the multiple positive qualities and values (both monetary and non-monetary) regarding data security and leverage that are furthered by broad adoption are made measurable (through duty performance metrics) and are supported by a legal narrative, enabling a reliable, predictable, rights-preserving, risk-reduced, distributed data sharing and processing platform for individuals and entities to engage in commercial transactions and social and political interactions.</p>

</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[x] The higher quality of such data is due to lower &ldquo;Shannon information entropy,&rdquo; lower legal risk, enhanced data provenance tracking, accountability, better meta-data, etc.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[xi] From a &ldquo;game theory&rdquo; perspective, this limitation helps to reduce the system inefficiency of the free-rider problem.&nbsp; If parties can get benefits (as &ldquo;third party beneficiaries&rdquo;) without having to bind themselves to the Data User duties, why would they self bind to the duties under this Agreement.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[xii] Note that this &ldquo;private right of action&rdquo; is central to the scalability of the enforcement mechanism.&nbsp; If the enforcement is centralized (single node of decision/enforcement), or even &ldquo;decentralized&rdquo; (multiple &ldquo;single&rdquo; nodes of decision/enforcement), it will be entirely blind to &ldquo;distributed&rdquo; information (no centralized notes of decision/enforcement).&nbsp; The Agreement &ldquo;recruits&rdquo; or &ldquo;deputizes&rdquo; Registered Parties in the &ldquo;distributed&rdquo; Internet architecture to be part of the infrastructure, including the performance of the auditing, accounting and enforcement functions of the infrastructure.&nbsp; Each party has a shared interest in reliable, predictable, accountable, auditable, transparent, easy to use, etc. system function.&nbsp; Compare, the alignment of stakeholder incentives manifested by pooling of &ldquo;by catch&rdquo; (catching of unpermitted species) in fisheries as way of aligning stakeholder interests.&nbsp; Compare also, FDIC insurance pooling of premiums as &ldquo;aligning&rdquo; bank interests.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[xiii] Which includes various duties to forbear from those actions that are inconsistent with and undermine various Data Rights Owner&rsquo;s rights.</p>

</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[xiv] The scalability is fostered in this initial Agreement through a process of incorporation of provisions intended to address various data system stakeholder needs (based on observations of the provisional &ldquo;requirements&rdquo; manifested in various current data standardization initiatives), and will be perpetuated by repeated re-surveying of a broad range of stakeholder data needs to identify commonality, along with the contract modification processes that can present that commonality back to Registered Parties as a set of candidate shared duties and rights for consideration for adoption by the stakeholders from which they were generated.&nbsp; There are multiple types of structures and processes that can manifest this &ldquo;feedback&rdquo; process, which in the commercial setting are generically referenced as &ldquo;markets,&rdquo; but which also manifest in other social (reputation) and political (voting) structures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The exercise of cohering the group of Registered Parties under the Agreement is akin to convening a &ldquo;body without organs&rdquo; in the words of Deleuze.&nbsp; The multiple new value propositions in the categories of security (privacy, etc.), and leverage (big data, etc.) that are merging in the data layer add new dimensionality for a entirely new data super-structure layer, much like derivatives (which are all forms of &ldquo;insurance products,&rdquo; broadly defined) formed an entirely new super-structure layer around the financial markets, and entrained those markets, as the collective imagination associated with the value propositions in that new super-structure layer developed (and in fact &ldquo;over-developed&rdquo; as their isolation from measurement enabled the most recent &ldquo;bubble&rdquo; and subsequent financial collapse in the line of such events that have occurred with a periodicity of about 30 years since 1800 in Western financial systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The derivatives market setting in the U.S. and elsewhere was hobbled with a dependence on a more traditional hybrid regulatory/self regulatory structure born in the Securities and Exchanges Act of 1934, etc., and similar laws in other countries, which (of regulatory necessity) place an outer boundary on the definitions of stakeholders and transactions that are either within and outside of the regulated market (derivatives were outside until Dodd Frank financial reform legislation slightly expanded the regulated territory).&nbsp; This &ldquo;boundary&rdquo; is the arbitrageurs territory of operations, where information differentials between market participants and those outside of the market differ, and the information of the market participants is equalized vis a vis the thing regulated.&nbsp; These &ldquo;information differentials&rdquo; mark the market.&nbsp; See MIT Kerberos paper regarding Godel&rsquo;s &ldquo;Incompleteness Theory as applied to markets boundaries).&nbsp;</p>

<p>In contrast, the &ldquo;rule making&rdquo; (aka &ldquo;self-regulatory&rdquo;) portion of the current Agreement will be captured in the &ldquo;Amendments/modifications&rdquo; section of the Agreement.&nbsp; The structure seeks to answer the question, &ldquo;What would a &ldquo;self-regulatory&rdquo; organization look like if the &ldquo;self&rdquo; was not a group of traditional businesses, but rather ordinary people in their role as data producers (aka &ldquo;Data Rights Owners&rdquo;).&rdquo;&nbsp; It will anticipate stakeholder-based processes (fractal from the stakeholder sub-group perspective), that use statistical data (including &ldquo;big data&rdquo; sources, market data, etc.) to inform quasi-automated, quasi-market, processes for elevation of rules from local group practices, through candidacy as broader standards, to inclusion in the main section of the Agreement (and hence application across the entire Registered Party population).</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[xv] There is a practical reality of resource/information differentials among Registered Parties that will need to be addressed.&nbsp; An individual does not have the resources to engage directly in all of the actions required by this Agreement, not to even understand the Agreement fully.&nbsp; The test that has been applied in crafting this Agreement is &ldquo;how can it be made possible to enable the average person to participate.&rdquo;&nbsp; In fact, I started this project thinking, what Online Terms of Service and privacy policy would I draft for my mom if she had representation and resources like that of the largest corporate/governmental client.&nbsp;</p>

<p>System complexity does not have to preclude participation, as long as there is an intermediary structure that can assist and facilitate a institutionalized &ldquo;trust&rdquo; layer (that is built on the mechanistic trust of system reliable performance).&nbsp; This is characteristic of ALL consumer-facing products, whether tangible or intangible in complex/technology-dependent societies.&nbsp; For example, credit card systems, insurance, mortgage lending, cars, microwave ovens, computers, cell phones each rely on concepts and systems that are entirely beyond the understanding of nearly all people who use them, but the risks associated with such use are mollified by intermediary structures originated in some combination of commercial risk-spreading and governmental regulation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The reality is that many types of rights under the Agreement will be enforced through intermediary arrangements, such as sub-groups of Registered Users that have already shaped their data flow control systems to conform to various existing enforcement regimes (such as 1995 EU Data Directive in Europe, HIPAA, GLB, FERPA, in U.S., etc.).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Agreement forms a sort of &ldquo;marketplace framework&rdquo; in which each of these approaches to solving data security and privacy and related system integrity challenges for electronic records can present themselves as candidates for broader adoption.&nbsp; Thus, for example, the myriad internal data administration systems (including their hybrid structures of economic, legal and technical components) that have been put in place to comply with US HIPAA regulatory requirements have enabled those regulated organizations to achieve a level of system metrics and evaluation for data integrity architectures that is among the most matured in the U.S. context.&nbsp; If those regulated entities were to become parties to this Agreement, the duties and legal structures that characterize those systems could be adopted through Stakeholder agreement modification policies, to help guide the future development of this Agreement form.&nbsp; The same is true of the approaches being advocated for in the EU as part of the updated data directive.&nbsp; Each candidate solution for shared data management, which is a way in which each of these proposed &ldquo;standards&rdquo; can be interpreted, would find potential expression through the Agreements structure.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[xvi] This &ldquo;contractual&rdquo; approach is necessitated by the fact that the Internet is trans-jurisdictional, so the baseline agreement must be a contract.&nbsp; That does not preclude the local deployment of the duties under this Agreement by government directive, legislation, regulation, etc.&nbsp; As long as the duties and rights are uniform across affected populations, and the boundaries of one versus the other duties/rights sub-regime are clear, the source of the duties (i.e., legislation, regulation or contract) and the particular enforcement mechanism (criminal, civil, SRO, hybrid) is not critical.&nbsp; Consider, for example the various forms of credit enablement that are made available to consumers and their respective regulatory and contractual boundaries (such as credit card loans, mortgages, car loans, pay-day loans, etc., etc., etc.).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Legal systems involve rulemaking, operations and enforcement (see FINRA (formerly NASD) example in U.S. securities markets).&nbsp; For different types of self-regulatory organizations, the three different functions can be separated to be discharged by any combination of public and private parties.&nbsp; Thus, rulemaking and operations may be engaged in by stakeholders, but enforcement may rely on both private-contractual methods AND administrative and even judicial dispute resolution systems (this is the FINRA model &ndash; with the modification that the rulemaking is not done from &ldquo;whole cloth&rdquo; by the stakeholders, but is based on U.S. securities laws, with the regulatory details being contributed in stakeholder-based rulemaking processes).</p>

<p>ALL systems of legal rules (even those set up purely by contract) rely on public enforcement processes to some extent.&nbsp; Even those parties that promote the most extreme <em>laissez faire</em> positions asserted by U.S. business interests against regulation would not hesitate to resort to the courts and administrative processes to help enforce their respective interests.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, the dependency on local enforcement of private rights of action, where such actions rely on local judicial or administrative processes beyond those established under an agreement, means that an agreement (such as this Agreement) will have varying effect (and varying value) in those jurisdictions where the rule of law is weaker (at least where the access to courts, legal counsel, etc. is weaker).&nbsp; Consider whether to normatively cross-reference a global index of rule of law as a condition precedent to the ability to become a Registered Party.&nbsp; Such an external normative cross reference (in contract terms an &ldquo;incorporation by reference&rdquo;) would help to coax the standardization and adoption of generic rule of law concepts, providing the economic incentive associated with access to the lower entropy (both Shannon entropy and market entropy) data within the network.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[xvii] Akin to the rights established in bank customers, when banks performed &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; (&ldquo;narrow&rdquo;) banking security and leverage services, such as (i) safety deposit box function (security), (ii) trust services (security), (iii) the aggregation and lending deployment of deposits, (iv) the payment of interest on deposits (leverage); and (v) engagement in fractional reserve lending (leverage).</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[xviii] This Agreement contemplates a structure that can &ldquo;crowd-source&rdquo; various elements of the rulemaking, operations and enforcement that are base-line functions of any self-regulatory system.&nbsp; An &ldquo;SRO&rdquo; is needed due to the distributed, trans-jurisdictional nature of the Internet.&nbsp; This Agreement proposes a draft set of terms that don&rsquo;t address the &ldquo;substance&rdquo; of the rulemaking (as is the focus of most other efforts that are currently seeking to establish principles and rules for specifically what &ldquo;rights&rdquo; and &ldquo;duties&rdquo; will be imposed on parties), but rather provides a framework for global operation of such a system.&nbsp; Thus, one can think of the Operations, Enforcement, Rulemaking triad as:&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; Agreement frames the Operations, 2.&nbsp; Enforcement remains (ultimately) with nation states/co-administered regions (e.g., EU)(with initial levels of alternative dispute resolution under the Agreement and normatively cross-referenced regimes), and 3.&nbsp; Rulemaking is distributed among stakeholder groupings of the distributed legal system to match the distributed nature of the Internet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most private sector legal agreements are ultimately just formal documentation for a set of promises and arrangements that have economic impact.&nbsp; The economics, not the law, are typically the motivation for parties to self-bind to a contract, albeit the &ldquo;economics&rdquo; might typically involve the cost savings associated with the reduction of risk that comes from enforceable promises).&nbsp;</p>

<p>This Agreement is based on such economic considerations.&nbsp; In fact, the mutually-dependent rights and duties that are described in the Agreement are the web of promises that provide the risk reduction to Registered Parties in both their capacity as Data Rights Owners AND Data Users.&nbsp; Both roles present risks and opportunities that the Agreement seeks to help Registered Parties to exploit to their mutual advantage.&nbsp; Most of these are network effects that can only be realized through group cooperation (See materials on &ldquo;RNA Metacycles&rdquo; in NATURE, See book &ldquo;Beyond Mechanism,&rdquo; chapter 1 relating to &ldquo;auto-catalytic&rdquo; structures).&nbsp; The incentive/penalty structure is built directly into the matching of the rights/duties.&nbsp; The dependency is the incentive, i.e., if you don&rsquo;t perform the duties, you get kicked out of the contract &ldquo;club&rdquo; and cannot enjoy the benefits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ability to &ldquo;scale&rdquo; is achieved, since the duties follow the rights and vice versa as members of the population decide whether to join.&nbsp; If you want the rights (benefits of privacy, data security, reliability, auditability, accountability, monetization, improved data quality, reduced data transferee risk, etc. etc.), you need to take on the duties. &nbsp;Period.&nbsp; The <em>operations</em> can scale, since they are embedded in the activity of Registered Parties acting on their documented rights and duties.&nbsp; <em>Enforcement</em> can scale because the Agreement can normatively cross reference (and rely on) third party enforcement (outside of the contract) (like FINRA feeds into SEC enforcement and the U.S. court system).&nbsp; The remaining distribution challenge is <em>rulemaking</em> (since operations can scale and enforcement can adapt).&nbsp; That will involve data feedback loops to inform stakeholder populations, akin to the structure imagined for XBRL in SEC and U.S. Congress legislative initiatives to utilize that technology.&nbsp; Note, consider the issue of data &ldquo;feedback&rdquo; versus data &ldquo;feed forward&rdquo; here.&nbsp; Is the hybrid a &ldquo;Bayesian&rdquo; form of knowledge formation for crowd-sourced systems (See article in NATURE &ldquo;How to grow a mind:&nbsp; Knowledge construction in less than 12 month old humans&rdquo; &ndash; Bayesian knowledge construction).</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[xix] This benefit is analogous to that observable in the epidemiology of group immunity.&nbsp; If I wash my hands, it protects me against bacterial infection, and if everyone washes their hands, it confers &ldquo;herd immunity.&rdquo;&nbsp; Herd immunity enables free riders (people who don&rsquo;t bother to wash their hands, but still benefit from not being exposed to germs because their neighbors do).&nbsp; (See materials on population specialization in plants and bacterial species.&nbsp; Concept, for example, is that among bacteria forming a protective layer [name here], not all bacteria have to be involved in the formation of the protective layer for all to benefit.&nbsp; This is role specialization that benefits the group and benefits the individual other bacteria.&nbsp; (See Science Magazine Article on soil bacteria compounds as source of &ldquo;<u>anti</u>-biotics&rdquo; &ndash; Even though compounds can also be interpreted as &ldquo;signaling&rdquo; chemicals.&nbsp; See also, free rider issue in NATURE article on plant signaling chemicals released upon insect attack).&nbsp; Similarly, under the Agreement, if one Registered Party practices good &ldquo;data hygiene,&rdquo; it protects them individually (to some extent) and if a large population of users practice the same good data hygiene behavior, there are network effect benefits that cannot be derived through unilateral action.&nbsp; This enables risk reduction that cannot otherwise be achieved.&nbsp; This is an economic benefit that requires cooperation (See NATURE articles on eusocial species).</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[xx] Consider role of master agreement and schedules here.&nbsp; Terms common to ALL systems belong in the master agreement.&nbsp; The schedules enables details for different services to be set forth.&nbsp; Consider mechanism for Registered Parties to &ldquo;opt in&rdquo; to various schedules as part of Registration Process.&nbsp; Access to certain schedules might be &ldquo;restricted&rdquo; based on background law.&nbsp; For example, a person in the U.S. would not be able to &ldquo;opt out&rdquo; of the statutory protections of Gramm Leach Bliley&rsquo;s data security protections, etc.&nbsp; In addition to potential limitations imposed to protect consumer and individual rights, schedules can also accommodate expansion with additional provision of duties and rights, including normative cross references to third party standards, e.g., EU data directive, HIPAA, GLB, etc. external laws and rules.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[xxi] The foregoing paragraph, and others dealing with entry into the agreement, registration, notices and other contract communications, and related issues are currently drafted in a very traditional written legal agreement format. &nbsp;This is deliberate for this initial legal draft to provide a baseline legal reference document from which to construct the integrated, code based hybrid treatment of business, legal and technical rules.&nbsp; This is intended as the most comprehensive legal version of the system documentation, in an effort to provide a baseline document that can pass legal muster with various legal counsel for existing institutions that will be asked to consider adoption of the Agreement.&nbsp; Principle level documents leave too many issues for later discussion.&nbsp; This Agreement provides the details, since that is where principles meet reality and can be tested more adequately.&nbsp; The work to &ldquo;automate&rdquo; the processes, and to prepare the user interface is ongoing, and will be informed by the substance of the legal work in a &ldquo;design-build&rdquo; type of approach that appropriately reflects the &ldquo;Bayesian&rdquo; processes that the Agreement is designed to engender.</p>

<p>Thus, the provisions dealing with the various processes of joining, interacting with, and leaving the Registered Party community will be substantially modified (based on stakeholder input) from those in the present draft before the Agreement is finalized. This approach is merely for purposes of initial preparation of this legal material.&nbsp; When the Agreement terms are re-formatted for presentation and registration online, and integrated into an overall structure that incorporate the legal, business and technical terms, this and other provisions of the Agreement will be redrafted to anticipate the separate sets of actions that are required to carry online agreements, as opposed to traditional paper agreements, into effect</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[xxii] This form of agreement is intended to function both in situations where there either is or is not an existing relationship between the data rights owner and the commercial Registered Party entities that engage in one or more &ldquo;Data User&rdquo; functions.&nbsp; For example, if a person has a relationship with a telco provider, a health care entity, a financial entity, or a retailer, this agreement can be entered into in addition to any existing terms of service/privacy policy as additional terms to help define the relationship with respect to the rights and duties regarding data.&nbsp; In that context, it is a &ldquo;data rights gloss&rdquo; on the existing relationship.&nbsp; Compare other &ldquo;risk reduction&rdquo; glosses that can be volitionally adopted by parties, such as the myriad forms of insurance, warranty extensions, swaps, hedges, forward contracts, futures contracts, etc. etc.</p>

<p>This Agreement documents the relationship of parties from the perspective of the Data Rights Owners as a data &ldquo;producers,&rdquo; even though they are simultaneously also &ldquo;consumers&rdquo; of the underlying telco, health care, financial or retailer services.&nbsp; For example, if a Data Rights Owner purchases a book online, they are a &ldquo;consumer&rdquo; of the book, but they are a &ldquo;producer&rdquo; of the data about themselves that they offer to the book seller as part of the book purchase transaction.&nbsp; This draft Agreement documents that data &ldquo;counter flow&rdquo; relationship.&nbsp; (See material on the higher &ldquo;baud&rdquo; rate of digital monetary systems versus anonymous currency, and the value layers of third and fourth signal monetary systems here).&nbsp; In those cases, this Agreement would control to the extent of any discrepancy between its terms and any terms in any such existing agreement.&nbsp; Trust will follow reliability.&nbsp; Reliability can be fostered to conformity to shared rules regarding Data Use.</p>

<p>Separately, this Agreement can also be applied in situations where there is no underlying telco, financial, banking, retail or other relationship.&nbsp; In that case, this Agreement documents the entire relationship of the Data Rights Owner and the Data User.&nbsp; This setting can be conceived of as a stand-alone Data User services agreement.&nbsp; As the data/identity markets mature, there will be increasing specialization and differentiation of services, and intermediary entities will help to fill the service gaps by offering various specialized and add-on services.</p>

</div>

<div id="edn">
<p> Registered Parties are Entities that also have legal capacity.&nbsp; Individuals (other than minors, etc.) and legal persons are included.&nbsp; Note need for treatment of parents and guardians to represent those individuals that don&rsquo;t have legal capacity to contract.</p>
</div>
<a href="#_ednref" name="_edn23" title="">[xxiii]</a>
<div id="edn">
<p>[xxiv] For example, in a simple online purchase transaction, data is exchanged between the seller and purchaser, each is a &ldquo;data rights owner&rdquo; of certain data they provide to the other party, and each is a &ldquo;data user&rdquo; of the data supplied by the other.&nbsp; The nature of the rights differ, as do the potential harms involved, but there are aspects of mutual dependency of the roles that can form the foundation of a mutual &ldquo;self-binding&rdquo; to get benefits of an exchange of promises.&nbsp; When standard sets of duties and rights are recognized across populations, it is called a market, i.e., a &ldquo;safe zone&rdquo; for interaction where identified behaviors are normalized, giving life to identified rights.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[xxv] The approach of packaging rights and duties together is not that unusual, and characterizes the global credit card/payment card systems, for example.&nbsp; Notably, it will be necessary to create &ldquo;measured&rdquo; event of default provisions that enable a Registered Party to &ldquo;cure&rdquo; a default, without having to resort to Termination of such Registered User.&nbsp; The benefits of this Agreement can only be realized if individuals and entities are encouraged to remain as Registered Parties.&nbsp; Termination is a last resort, since Termination puts people outside of the system and its duties and is therefore counterproductive to the goal of more comprehensive adoption.&nbsp; Therefore, only those default events that negatively affect network operations should result in a Registered Party being disqualified from participation in the Agreement, and remedies should be appropriately &ldquo;escalated&rdquo; to enable system operational continuity.&nbsp; Toward this end, for example, the Agreement seeks to put in place various &ldquo;corrective&rdquo; and &ldquo;compensatory&rdquo; structures to avoid full default, such as the ESL system and its &ldquo;liquidated damages&rdquo; approach to breaches of duty under this Agreement. (See footnote describing ongoing research on indigenous forms of alternative dispute resolution for deployment online).</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[xxvi] The recognition of this interdependence, and the normalization of the behaviors that it engenders, is simultaneously the foundation of both security and leverage, i.e., (i) security in the form of enhanced online identity integrity to deliver greater privacy, authority, efficacy, control, insight, and comfort to individuals and entities acting online, and (ii) leverage in the form of the measurable value creation of a market-type exchange that occurs when data is used as valuable information within the &ldquo;containers&rdquo; of a set of standard terms (such as this Agreement), and the larger container of a market, in which populations of individuals act reliably based on such common terms.</p>
</div>

<p>[xxvii] Note that Data User duties can arise by operation of public law, public regulation, or private agreement, or a combination.&nbsp; The source is not as critical as the consistency of the &ldquo;standards of care&rdquo; associated with such duties.&nbsp; Where standards of care associated with duties are applied across populations, it enables the network effect of risk reduction at scale.&nbsp; A good portion of the value resides in the fact of agreement, rather than the particular thing agreed to. &nbsp;Consider that a traffic stoplight doesn&rsquo;t reduce risk because it is red (it could be purple, or any other visual signal), it reduces risk because the form of signal for &ldquo;stop&rdquo; is agreed to.&nbsp; Agreement, not the signal, reduces risk. &nbsp;</p>

<p>From this &ldquo;agreement reduces risk&rdquo; perspective, stakeholders should be encouraged to overlook minor differences in FIPPs and other principles in favor of identifying the commonalities of aspiration across jurisdictional boundaries.&nbsp; (See the FIPPs correlation materials that compare various FIPPs based on the substance of the various principles).&nbsp; There are a sufficient number of commonalities to warrant the creation of legal infrastructure built on these common needs to reduce every stakeholder&rsquo;s risk profile online in ways that cannot be accomplished unilaterally.&nbsp; This is not a unique context.&nbsp; For example, it is like the Uniform Commercial Code effort in the U.S. in the 1940&rsquo;s, where subsets of terms were standardized, without intruding on the ability of stakeholders participating in specific supply chains to create bespoke agreements.&nbsp; Like this Agreement, the UCC just provided default terms to help support legal interoperability across supply chain domains.&nbsp; That was for the mercantile, tangible goods supply chain within the borders of the United States; here we have a similar setting for intangibles (data, identity and its cousins), and on a global scale.&nbsp; The Agreement structure offers a similar solution for a scaled system for distributed Internet data flows.&nbsp; Note that the UCC setting involved a &ldquo;decentralized&rdquo; setting (multiple states as legal &ldquo;decision points&rdquo;), while the mercantile activity was &ldquo;distributed.&rdquo;&nbsp; In that setting, public law and private law created a hybrid structure that allocates responsibility for operations, rulemaking and enforcement, as is necessary here.&nbsp; That was done without US federal government input (it was a project of NCUSL), and so is a helpful model here in the current trans-jurisdictional setting.</p>

<div id="edn">
<p>[xxviii] It is anticipated that Registered Parties can be any person with legal capacity.&nbsp; Registered Parties acting as Data Rights Owners utilizing the services of Registered Parties acting as Data Users under this Agreement can be individuals or legal entities, hence the anticipation of &ldquo;Affiliates&rdquo; in the prior paragraph.&nbsp; Note that Data Rights Owners might &ldquo;store,&rdquo; process, and use data about themselves as well as other data (i.e., data that is not &ldquo;about&rdquo; them &ndash; such as family photos, home records, licensed copyrighted materials (books, movies, etc.), email history, etc.) using the Data User services, just as I could store pictures of both me and my family and friends and photos of scenery and objects in a safety deposit box.</p>

<p>The Agreement is intended to be uniformly adopted (think Uniform Commercial Code model legislation in the 1940&rsquo;s, but here it is a &ldquo;UIC,&rdquo; i.e., &ldquo;Uniform Information Code&rdquo; or &ldquo;Uniform Identity Code&rdquo;), across different entities offering elements of services that fall within the Agreement&rsquo;s definition of &ldquo;Services.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hence, the &ldquo;Services&rdquo; definition under the Agreement establishes the scope of application of this Agreement to existing relationships.&nbsp; This particular draft version of the Agreement is intended to establish one possible set of standard services terms for a subset of shared services for the emerging data/identity-related industries.&nbsp; The reference to &ldquo;standard&rdquo; terms is deliberate, since it is the standardization of terms, and thereby the standardization of rights and duties, that is carried into effect by broad adoption of a standard form contract.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By limiting the extent to which a particular entity can alter the core terms of the standard agreement form, all Data User entities that use a standard form contract in effect become &ldquo;one&rdquo; larger virtual Data User from the Data Rights Owner&rsquo;s perspective.&nbsp; (and all Data Users that are subject to a single iteration of an Agreement schedule are also part of a single larger virtual Data User composed of other Registered Parties that operate under the same Service schedule version).&nbsp; The Data Rights Owner can treat ALL Data Users as one with respect to a given Service, because they all perform the same baseline duties.&nbsp; It is like dealing with brokers in the stock exchanges, all of which are subject to a baseline set of regulated duties, but which compete on other, unregulated, terms.&nbsp; That adoption and market formation cannot be compelled (unless seeking risk reduction and economic benefit is considered to constitute a form of &ldquo;compulsion&rdquo;).&nbsp; It is a voluntary common binding to uniform contract duties that yields mutual benefit.&nbsp; Where a single data rights management form of agreement is adopted across populations of users, each such contract is, in effect, a manifestation of an instance of the data rights market defined by those standard terms.&nbsp; All successful markets share common terms for various processes and transactions and, conversely, the adoption of common terms can be seen as an engine of market creation; it is a bit of a &ldquo;chicken and egg&rdquo; issue of which came first, the market or the standard terms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, 100% standardization/uniformity is also undesirable.&nbsp; Value potential and arbitrage exists in difference (See MIT Kerberos materials on comparison of thermodynamic limit of engine efficiency based on temperature differentials to economic limit of arbitrage efficiency to information differentials). To encourage innovation and competition, Data Users (and traditional companies in the telco, financial, healthcare, retail and other areas) can offer greater protection and more services than their competitors by taking on duties (and making promises) that exceed those of the basic agreement.&nbsp; However, for the driving risk reduction benefit to be realized, they cannot offer less protective services than whatever baseline duties are ultimately required by the final form of this or another common Agreement.&nbsp; Ultimately the precise terms of the final, consensus-based agreement is almost less important than the fact of common adoption, which yields the legal and risk reduction equivalent of the &ldquo;network effect.&rdquo;&nbsp; Agreement is the source of risk reduction.&nbsp; Agreement is the source of complexity reduction.</p>

<p>In effect, this draft Agreement is a proposal for a normative &ldquo;legal specification&rdquo; (to borrow from technical standard setting parlance).&nbsp; Broad adoption of some version of such a legal specification could help to enable data portability among Registered Parties that are signatories to this standard form.&nbsp; This form of agreement is intended to suggest one possible legal infrastructure so support broad, interoperable Data User function, and a possible set of economic incentives to provide an engine, in a structure that fosters the realization of Data Rights Owner interests, whether those interests are based on fundamental rights, constitutional rights, statutory rights, regulatory rights, economic rights, contractual rights, etc.&nbsp; This Agreement provides a mode to realize such rights from whatever source by providing a coherent source of economic benefits to all stakeholders.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Data portability, and indeed data flow generally, is currently constrained by a lack of legal interoperability. Individual instances of legal limitations on data flow (such as individual statutes in the U.S. (HIPAA, GLB, FERPA, FCRA, etc.) are rational responses to data security challenges at the time of passage of each such legislative solution.&nbsp; The net effect of myriad statutes, cases, regulations and enforcement policies across multiple jurisdictions is not, however, characterized by any particular overall legal architecture.&nbsp; The interaction of the various limitations has not itself been &ldquo;engineered&rdquo; into a workable solution (ask any legal practitioner in any jurisdiction about the state of e-commerce law internationally &ndash; but hold the phone away from your ear before you get the response).</p>

<p>Stakeholder-derived data flow controls appropriately directed at a specific purpose are good; at least the intentions underlying those initiatives are good.&nbsp; However, in a world of hyper connectivity and big data benefits, they also result inadvertent, and very undesirable, data flow constriction resulting merely from a lack of architected legal solutions across jurisdictional boundaries.&nbsp; The history of data legislation globally to date is not &ldquo;privacy by design,&rdquo; but &ldquo;data friction by inadvertence.&rdquo;&nbsp; The causes and effects of data flow limitations vary, some are desirable while some are not; but many are due merely to a lack of &ldquo;legal interoperability.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is not just about monetary value realization (although it is certainly about that), but also about all other forms of value realization.&nbsp; Privacy, online identity integrity, security, risk limitation, etc. are all served by more comprehensive approaches.&nbsp; The concept of their being separate types of &ldquo;healthcare data,&rdquo; versus &ldquo;financial data,&rdquo; versus &ldquo;personal data,&rdquo; versus &ldquo;education data&rdquo; is an anachronistic artifact of these sectorial regulatory regimes and bears little relevance in a massively interconnected world.&nbsp; All data can be deployed in multiple contexts to &ldquo;inform&rdquo; a Data User (and thus become valuable &ldquo;inform-ation&rdquo; at the point of data use.&nbsp; Prior to that time, the &ldquo;type&rdquo; of data cannot be characterized.&nbsp; The data level is therefore the wrong level at which to define the duty.&nbsp; Instead it should be at the time of creation of information when data is used, and its value (or harm) can first be discerned.&nbsp; The EU approach is less sectorial, and therefore already reflects this perspective, and the data-information distinction (Shannon) and concept of shared rules across sectors might find fertile soil there.&nbsp; US Registered Parties that are involved in data regulated businesses (under HIPAA, GLB, FERPA, etc.) will typically find themselves happy to merely achieve sectorial compliance, without a sense of compulsion to apply the resources to design, develop and deploy cross-sectorial data management regimes unless there is a sense of competitive opportunity to exploring such expanded systems.&nbsp; That sense is growing as the value propositions presented by shared data mature.</p>

<p>By way of illustration, consider that, at present, data is not restricted from flowing freely between the EU and the US as the result of a lack of technical interoperability, but rather the challenges of &ldquo;legal interoperability.&rdquo;&nbsp; From a technical perspective, data could be shared tomorrow across multiple jurisdictions were it not for the actual (and concern over the perceived) differences in the &ldquo;standard of care&rdquo; across jurisdictions applied to each of the various sets of duties assigned to roles under recognized categories (such as &ldquo;relying party,&rdquo; &ldquo;data subject,&rdquo; &ldquo;attribute provider,&rdquo; etc.).&nbsp;&nbsp; The broad adoption of common legal terms (like the &ldquo;legal network effect&rdquo; of the de facto standards of compulsory legislation or regulation) also permits interoperability and the data flow that is needed among separate legal entities.]</p>

<p>[NOTE:&nbsp; There are a variety of services provided under the Agreement.&nbsp; Among these are both &ldquo;lock down&rdquo; protection services for so-called &ldquo;Vault Data,&rdquo; and &ldquo;publicity agent-type&rdquo; sharing services for &ldquo;Vault Data,&rdquo; rendered at the sole choice of the Data Rights Owner.&nbsp; Notably, even where the &ldquo;lock down&rdquo; services are desired to maximize privacy of an individual, i.e., even to assure privacy with no anticipated &ldquo;external&rdquo; transfer of data, the standard terms are needed since data about the average person is already stored on approximately 2750 servers [Check Dutch study from 2009?].&nbsp; Multiple Registered Parties are anticipated to be bound under one basic form of agreement (with minor modifications and localizations accommodated to offer enhanced Services).&nbsp; Like the common payment card system rules of PCI-DSS, the anticipated system is &ldquo;virtual&rdquo; at some levels, in that its organizational and governance structure is not entirely &ldquo;centralized&rdquo; except by conformity to common rules.&nbsp; This Agreement is intended to function as the baseline for those common rules, with Schedules added to fill out the details for specific contexts, jurisdictions and sectors.]<strong><em>.</em></strong></p>

<p>[xxxiv] Are there other categories of new data management services that should be appended to the foregoing or should be added as new service categories?]</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[xxxv] Each of the Services described below is accompanied by notes that correlate that service to a specific category of traditional Fair Information Practice Principle (FIPPs) that have been adopted as principles, directives or legislation in various jurisdictions and various forms over the past 40 years (since the first version created in the US by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) in 1973).&nbsp; The current Agreement is designed to enable market competition among institutional Data Users offering data rights management services that is intended to result in innovation and elaboration of the current FIPPs to the benefit of Data Rights Owners. &nbsp;In that competitive market, &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; can ultimately arise as populations gravitate to Services that offer preferred solutions.&nbsp; This takes maximum advantage of several of the things that &ldquo;markets&rdquo; (grossly defined) do well, i.e., innovation to address user needs, and discovery of economical solutions.&nbsp; The emerging best practices can be multiple, and each will be a potential candidate for standardization.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this way, the &ldquo;market&rdquo; in these services is part of where the standardization in effect &ldquo;evolves,&rdquo; through the selective pressure of the market mechanism, and the participants in the market all participate in the &ldquo;creation&rdquo; of those standards through the preference expressed by their service purchase decisions, enabled by data portability and process transparency and accountability.&nbsp; See reference to &ldquo;Networks, Crowds and Markets&rdquo; by _____ which includes the assertion that there are two ways that groups make decisions, i.e., voting and markets, the latter (markets) being characteristic of where more than one decision can be maintained simultaneously, and the former (voting) covering situations where only one decision is to be made and maintained.</p>

<p>[xxxvii] These Services are intended to provide security and system and data integrity, conformity to standards, enforceability, and auditability to the data storage function.&nbsp; The system challenges associated with the &ldquo;Storage FIPPs&rdquo; and &ldquo;Security FIPPs&rdquo; are addressed by these Services as a baseline.</p>

</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[xxxix] Note: cross reference provision that requires Data User to transfer Vault Data on request of Data Rights Owner.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[xl] The foregoing sentence is necessary to make sure that anyone that handles data does so only when</p>

<p>subject to the obligations and duties of this Agreement.&nbsp; That is necessary to make sure that Vault Data is protected as set forth herein, and that any re-identification of Circulating Data into Vault Data by an Observer User of Circulating Data will give rise to &ldquo;springing&rdquo; duties imposed under this agreement that can protect the interests of Data Subjects.&nbsp; The &ldquo;bubble&rdquo; of contract rights protection travels along with the data by forcing adoption of the Agreement to get the data and the risk reduction &ldquo;nectar&rdquo; offered by the Agreement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The prior sentence of the Agreement is an important one, since it describes the &ldquo;legal container&rdquo; for PII.&nbsp; By having the requirement that any Data User of Vault Data or Circulating Data first enter into this Agreement, it is like operating a road paving machine in front of a traffic jam; the agreement &ldquo;paves the way&rdquo; for the Data traffic to flow reliably and predictably.&nbsp; Without the Agreement, data transfers will continue to be a &ldquo;rough road&rdquo; that will damage all parties&rsquo; interests and be more wasteful and costly for all concerned.</p>

<p>The requirement that Data Users of Vault Data and Circulating be bound by this Agreement will also tend to cause the contract to be &ldquo;viral&rdquo; in a positive way. &nbsp;Like membership warehouse stores, you need to be a member to get into the store to enjoy the benefits.</p>

<p>[NOTE:&nbsp; A subset of Observer Users of Vault Data includes Relying Parties, who will benefit from the greater data integrity and reliability and efficient and limited query options that are made possible through use of this system.&nbsp; Analysis of the relationship of popular notions of &ldquo;privacy&rdquo; (what data subjects want) and &ldquo;assurance&rdquo; (what relying parties want) reveals that the two concepts are directly inversely related.&nbsp; Stated otherwise, the more data a Relying Party receives about a data subject, the more they can &ldquo;know&rdquo; about the subject.&nbsp; The greater the &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; possessed by a Relying Party, the greater the potential for intrusion harm (of which traditional &ldquo;privacy&rdquo; is a subset) to the Data Subject.&nbsp; This is the same inverse relationship dynamic that characterizes U.S. 4<sup>th</sup> amendment jurisprudence, i.e., police want access to a home to get the best information (evidence), but are required to get a warrant because access to that rich information is the most potentially intrusive.&nbsp; The &ldquo;dynamic tension&rdquo; between intrusion and assurance is not sidestepped, but is addressed directly by this Agreement; in fact it is the source of the economic-risk reduction benefit that the Agreement seeks to cohere to the benefit of ALL Registered Parties.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The source of the problems is the source of the solutions.&nbsp; The data use system can be most satisfactorily configured within a set of overarching legal infrastructures in which the various tensions between privacy and identity assurance, between privacy and big data, between individual and group control of data and the information that it yields, etc. can be balanced and harmonized. The ability to normalize these dynamic tensions save costs and enables the development of complimentary and contiguous systems, services and markets; and is therefore a source of value for both parties.&nbsp; This is the economic compulsion that will drive adoption.&nbsp; As is typically the case, &ldquo;co-opetition&rdquo; structures require a combination of imagination, serendipity, individual entity leadership, accident and exhaustion of alternatives to get traction. . . and a significant measure of patience.</p>

<p>The Agreement provides the Parties with a legal platform/&rdquo;operating system,&rdquo; through which to engage in the resolution of the dynamic tension that is caused whenever data is used/observed to create Personal Identifying Information (or information that is owned by a legal entity for that matter, e.g., Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems) in any given context, fairly and with full information and confidence in the reliability, consistency and enforceability of the promises made as part of that negotiation.]</p>

<p>[NOTE:&nbsp; Also, by exposing this class of data services to the market, the precise nature of new forms of potential harmful intrusions can be &ldquo;unpacked&rdquo; and explored over populations, with &ldquo;best practices&rdquo; providing insights into potential collective stakeholder notions of intrusion harms, as well as new solutions.]</p>

<p>[NOTE:&nbsp; Relying Parties fall into at least two types, those that rely on Vault Data directly to inform their inference about assurance, and those that rely on Vault Meta Data (or even Circulating Data) to make such inferences.&nbsp; Those Relying Parties that receive Vault Data know who the Data Subject is, while those that rely on Vault Meta Data or Circulating Data may not know who the Data Subject is.</p>

<p>An example of the latter (Relying Parties that rely on meta data or Circulating Data), includes those parties that receive, not data, but rather an affirmation from the Data User Owner that the Data Subject is a member of a class of interest to such relying party to help inform a particular inference in a given context (e.g., is X over 21?&nbsp; Is X and Employee of a company?&nbsp; Is X a holder of an account?&nbsp; etc.).]</p>

<p>[NOTE: To protect Data Rights Owners (particularly individual and small business Data Rights Owners) from potential abuse, Data Rights Owner cannot waive this obligation of Data User to abide by the rules applicable to Vault Data established herein. This limitation on Data Rights Owner discretion is intended, somewhat paternalistically perhaps, to protect Data Rights Owners from making decisions that can undermine their ability to enjoy data identity integrity in future transactions.&nbsp; Thus, under the Agreement, while forms of DATA INTERESTS are &ldquo;alienable&rdquo; (can be transferred) by or on behalf of Data Rights Owners, their RIGHTS to make those decisions are not themselves alienable (subject to their being &ldquo;delegable&rdquo; to one or more Data Users).&nbsp; Notably, the question of alienability of rights invokes discussion of &ldquo;fundamental rights&rdquo; and possible shared bases for legal interoperability based on such shared rights.&nbsp; The examination and comparative analysis of the precise question of alienability and inalienability of various rights at the boundaries of a citizen&rsquo;s self may reveal additional bases on which to link the US and EU approaches (i.e., by comparison of EU &ldquo;fundamental rights&rsquo; with a mixture of US constitutional authority under the first, fourth, fifth and fourteenth amendments), along with those of other jurisdictions as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This research is ongoing, particularly with respect to the first amendment question.&nbsp; This is intended to capture the notion of identity as a &ldquo;fundamental right&rdquo; as in the EU.&nbsp; The nature and application, of that right needs to be examined to understand its implications, both domestically within the EU and for purposes of informing potential harmonization.&nbsp; It does so in this way: &ldquo;Identity&rdquo; in this context is associated with the control of the expressive and perceptual channels themselves, rather than just the particular data transferred over them.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rdquo; am not the same as the data about me.&nbsp; The focus on data is a red herring in a sense, since the essence of identity control/privacy is channel control as input and output (at least under the 4 common law privacy torts).&nbsp; This Agreement seeks to sort out the control of the respective channels. &nbsp;Each separate Service is a separate sub-channel of either the &ldquo;expression channel&rdquo; or the &ldquo;perception channel.&rdquo;&nbsp; By controlling the characteristics of the channels, Data Rights Owners can control their privacy and identity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Data Rights Owner does not own Data; they own &ldquo;Data Rights.&rdquo;&nbsp; A Data Rights Owner &ldquo;owns&rdquo; the right to control data flows to and from them.&nbsp; Some theorists (Doug Hofstadter being one) are of the view that &ldquo;identity&rdquo; itself is an emergent phenomenon of the accumulated expression of individual experience of their lifelong expressive and perceptual data channels.&nbsp; In a sense, it is like a form of rights that is similar <em>droit morale</em> rights in copyright, but here in the identity rather than the copyright context.&nbsp; This agreement simply seeks to operationalize these rights and subject them to measurement/accounting.]</p>

<p>These Services are also intended to provide protection for the individual against the updated potential online privacy intrusion harms that can be rendered legally cognizable based on the traditional privacy tort of misappropriation, i.e., the use of name or likeness of a person by another WITHOUT permission for commercial purposes.&nbsp; In a sense, the agreement surfaces the discussion of a potentially cognizable paradigm for &ldquo;appropriation,&rdquo; in the updated context of data, i.e., the use of DATA about name, likeness AND other characteristics, WITH permission for economic purposes, and provides an enforceable contract mechanism to enable the scalable realization of those rights.&nbsp; The Agreement sets forth contract rights that address the same types of harms/risks as those addressed in the tort rights context of misappropriation.]&nbsp;</p>

<p>[xlix] [NOTE:&nbsp; ESLs serve several functions in the Agreement.&nbsp; They are mainly directed to those situations where the party in the role of Data User is engaging in that role on a commercial, governmental or other institutional basis, and therefore has the resources and institutional controls necessary to deliver scalable, consistent Services.&nbsp; Many Data Users will be individuals, however, and will not, strictly speaking, be providing &ldquo;Services&rdquo; even though their duties under this Agreement are defined, in gross, as the &ldquo;Services.&rdquo;&nbsp; For institutional Data Users, ESLs can provide a basis for competitive differentiation, the ability to specifically address Data Rights Owner national, regional, or local issues (such as varying privacy regimes), sectorial compliance requirements (such as HIPAA, GLB, FERPA, etc, in the U.S. and Data Directives in the EU for example), and other Data Rights Owner choice (including among various offerings of &ldquo;identity integrity&rdquo; and other &ldquo;privacy&rdquo; related sets of commitments/duties to fulfill bespoke identity and privacy needs of various stakeholder subgroups in myriad subjective and contextual settings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ESLs allow Data Users to compete on privacy services.&nbsp; The intention is that those ESLs that become pervasive, and commoditized, can move to the Agreement through the Schedules and then directly to section 3 if they are sufficiently universal.&nbsp; In this way, the ESLs recruit Data Users operating in markets to do the programming and assembly work for future data systems, pursuant to the requirements established by stakeholders expressing preferences in system feedback loops that constitute sub-markets, that roll up into sets of general preferences.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That system/rules development process is evident only from a broad system perspective.&nbsp; More locally, within the operation of the system, and from a Data Rights Owner perspective, ESLs provide a baseline of measurable duties and corresponding standards of care for the various sub-elements of the Services.&nbsp; In so doing, it supports a form of &ldquo;liquidated damages&rdquo; provision that is intended to address the challenges of scaling the dispute resolution system for the Services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Specifically, given the potential volume of data transfer actions that will be undertaken pursuant to standard data User agreements (with respect to both Vault Data and Circulating Data) over the entire population of Data Rights Owners and Data Users (potentially in the billions of transactions on a system wide basis), disputes must be handled as expeditiously as possible, while still maintaining process fairness and substantive fairness (&ldquo;due process&rdquo;).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Standard due process &ldquo;notice, hearing and tribunal&rdquo; will not easily scale to online information utility systems.&nbsp; With that many interactions, there will be system disputes, and likely many of them. Under standard &ldquo;80/20&rdquo; rule notions, it is likely that the nature of the disputes will cluster, with the same type of fact settings arising repeatedly in a &ldquo;bell curve&rdquo; type distribution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As statistics are accumulated about the nature of the disputes over the system of multiple Data Users, the cost of resolution of such disputes will become better known as well as the settings in which particular types of disputes occur.&nbsp; For those disputes that are common and for which the harm is statistically calculable, ESLs can be established.</p>

<p>Once an ESL is established, dispute resolution can be streamlined to a three-part process.&nbsp; First, the dispute is asserted online by a Data Rights Owner.&nbsp; Second, the Data User investigates and provides Vault Meta Data and other data to help the parties to evaluate the situation against the objective tests of the relevant ESL (if there is no ESL, or the parties cannot agree on an ESL, then the dispute is handled by alternative means (including online mediation, arbitration-type approaches that are described in sections ___of this Agreement).&nbsp; Third, if the objective tests of the relevant ESL are met, the Data User offers to pay (or offsets the Service Charges of) the Data Rights Owner in full discharge of the matter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If a matter is not resolved to the satisfaction of the Data Rights Owner with the payment offered, escalation processes will be provided, always with the Data Rights Owner&rsquo;s interest being held as primary; and with attention to scalable processes.&nbsp; The basic function of the system is to resolve disputes as quickly and &ldquo;automatically&rdquo; as possible where the cost of the dispute resolution exceeds the damages associated with the original harm.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The quality and attractiveness of a particular Data User&rsquo;s ESL and their overall dispute resolution system is a feature of the &ldquo;privacy&rdquo; and other services offered by that Data User, and can be a competitive differentiator, and a way that Data Users can seek to attract new Data Rights Owners as customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like a bank that seeks to attract deposits to enable it to engage in the most extensive fractional reserve lending possible, the more Vault Data to which a Data User ahs access, the more Circulating Data they can create, and the more Data Leverage they can produce, to the benefit of the Data User, the Data Rights Owner, and other Data User system beneficiaries.&nbsp; An example of an ESL might be the undertaking by the Data User to provide a year of paid credit monitoring following a data breach event such as that which is the subject of the majority of U.S. state data breach laws.</p>

<p>Today&rsquo;s ESL is tomorrow&rsquo;s candidate data rights management service standard.&nbsp; These data breach events happen with relative frequency (and will likely to continue into the future given the complex, iterative &ldquo;cat and mouse&rdquo; nature of security) and the costs of credit monitoring as a &ldquo;response&rdquo; are known.]</p>

<p>[Research NOTE:&nbsp; From an &ldquo;artificial intelligence perspective, discuss whether an ESL can be thought of as a legal &ldquo;sigmoidal neuron,&rdquo; i.e., a tunable artificial neuron in the context of neural network architectures.&nbsp; Consider whether setting of thresholds for ESL and the contractual results of same are equivalent to the &ldquo;weightings&rdquo; of input and output neurons in neural network &ldquo;feed-forward&rdquo; network architectures.&nbsp; If so, consider the alternative developed neural network architectures (see e.g., Wikipedia page relating to same), as potential contract architectures to engender various feed forward qualities in data contract duties (and future data Services markets).]</p>

<div id="edn">
<p>[li] Since the ESLs are intended to be applied in the context of a relationship with a commercial Data User, the fee reduction mechanism (as a form of surrogate liquidated damages) is intended to take advantage of the existing compensation flow established in a commercial setting.&nbsp; In alternative settings, where institutions such as governments and NGOs establish ESLs, but there is no corresponding fee structure to reduce, alternative forms of enforcement of ESL standards-of-care will need to be developed.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[lii] &nbsp;The following provision is intended to elicit current reporting from all Data Users that use this common form of standardized agreement.&nbsp; The accumulated data about performance against ESLs can help Data Rights Owners to learn more about the quality of Service offered by various Data Users, and to &ldquo;port&rdquo; their Vault Data (and business) to the best services.&nbsp; Education about these terms, radical operational transparency, and the publication and presentation of these performance reports enable the market in identity services/privacy services/ data services to be made visible.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[liii] For purposes of scale, this is only online.&nbsp; Requiring printed materials for these data &ldquo;sub-micro-transactions&rdquo; would destroy the possibility of system scale.&nbsp; The potential evanescence of online data records can be addressed by Data Rights Owners printing copies of online statements, if desired.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[liv] The ESLs will need to be distinguished from CESLS in future drafts.&nbsp; The intention is that different Data Users can introduce new ESLs and CESLS to introduce new candidate best practices for consideration as future legal standards for inclusion in the Agreement and its Schedules.&nbsp; It is anticipated that ESLs can be established for application to all Data Users, but this will be a small set initially, given the differences in institutional capacity among Data Users at the inception of the Agreement.&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[lv] This is one of the settings in which the question arises of how to &ldquo;align&rdquo; the various Data Users sufficiently so that the larger system benefits can be realized (such as portability, scalable interoperability across jurisdictions, innovation from a broad stable platform and, as here, insurability, etc.).&nbsp; This includes the question of having uniform ESL development across the population of Data Users.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The challenge is that some Data Users will be in a better position to deliver on some ESLs than others, so there will be disparity in the performance experience that might make it difficult for all Data Users to adopt a given ESL at the same time. However, we don&rsquo;t want to just defer to the &ldquo;lowest common denominator&rdquo; of performance among Data Users by setting Data User sector ESL levels at the level of the least capable performer.&nbsp; A conundrum.</p>

<p>Perhaps one way to drive the behavior of Data Users toward ESL adoption and performance is to create an &ldquo;insurance pool&rdquo; to fund ESL payouts, that is funded by multiple Data Users, and to make access to that pool available only to Data Users that adopt a given set of ESLs.&nbsp; The &ldquo;premiums&rdquo; paid in by Data Users could be correlated with performance against ESLs to incentivize improvement.&nbsp; If you have a better performance record, you pay less into the fund.&nbsp; Again, ESLs are supposed to be a shortcut.&nbsp; In this way, the risk to the pool can be correlated directly to the ESL performance of the parties.&nbsp; Perhaps membership in the pool is mandatory, but the required pay in (&ldquo;premium&rdquo;) for each Data User is based on ESL performance and other metrics (what gets measured gets done].</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[lvi] Data Users will range from individuals to large commercial and governmental institutions.&nbsp; Clearly, individuals will have few, if any, dedicated resources associated with their responsibilities as Data Users.&nbsp; The implication is that the set of resources for all Data Users will need to be set at a minimum.&nbsp; However, commercial users with more resources will be able to deploy those resources under various CESLS, which will enable them to distinguish themselves among institutional Registered Parties acting as Data Users.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This provision is among several that will need to be unpacked and re-crafted to anticipate the scaling challenges of standards being applied across the range of possible Registered Parties, i.e., all individuals and entities with legal capacity to contract, sue and be sued, etc.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[lvii] This section is associated with scope of use.&nbsp; It helps the Data User to discern level of risk to which it is exposed as a result of providing the Services in order to help it to evaluate its cost structure and any insurance (including ESL pooled-risk structures among Data Users), self-insurance, and reserve requirements.&nbsp; This section is currently crafted &ldquo;in the negative&rdquo; (describing only what cannot be done, not what can be done with the Services) based on the expectation that the Data User functionality will be used/relied upon by Data Rights Owners in a wide variety of sectors, industries and jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There may be, particularly in the early years of the nascent market, certain high risk activities (military operations, nuclear power plant operation, handling of toxins or pathogens, air traffic control, etc.) where it would be prudent to carve out certain elements of the Data Services from being used in such limited contexts until such time as empirical data is collected that demonstrates the reliability of these systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is also possible to draft this provision &ldquo;in the positive,&rdquo; describing those uses that are anticipated (and permitted).&nbsp; This question should be revisited following review of those common Data Rights Owner needs and uses to which the Data User Services are being put in the overall market. &nbsp;That review can also help to inform those subsets of Data User services that are sufficiently commonly desired across the entire Data User market so that it makes sense to document them in the standard form agreement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, if a significant number of Data Rights Owners are using the Services to handle health information, the scope description might reference existing services that comply with the HIPAA regime (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), and HIPAA compliant practices might help inform a greater proportion of the default provisions of the standard form of Data User agreement.]</p>

<p>&nbsp;[NOTE:&nbsp; Describe types of uses by Data Rights Owner here.&nbsp; Do we want to separate different sectors by breaking them out separately in this provision?&nbsp; In the consideration of this provision regarding permitted uses, note also to address not only the Data Rights Owner&rsquo;s&nbsp; &ldquo;warehousing-type&rdquo; service rights, but also those uses associated with other aspects of &ldquo;data leverage&rdquo; which is dependent on the managed use of data and supports Data Rights Owners&rsquo; efficacy as data &ldquo;producers.&rdquo;&nbsp; In those contexts where commercialization of data is sought by Data Rights Owners and such commercialization is appropriate, the Data Users are acting as &ldquo;publicity agents&rdquo; for the &ldquo;digital self&rdquo; of those Data Rights Owners that desire to exploit the data leverage value inherent in the data that is of interest to the Data User]</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[lviii] [NOTE:&nbsp; In this section Data Rights Owners can request of Data Users that they create custom Services (or versions of existing services) to better address such Data Rights Owner&rsquo;s needs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If only one Data Rights Owner makes a request in a population of users, it is unlikely to prompt a Data User to invest the resources in development, but multiple requests could suggest that there is an underlying market opportunity that the Data User might want to explore further.&nbsp; Thus, from the Data User perspective, this section is in the nature of &ldquo;market research,&rdquo; based on unsolicited service requests received by Data User from Data Rights Owners.]</p>

<p>[NOTE: &nbsp;Another element of Service &ldquo;customization&rdquo; involves the manner in which one or more of the Services interfaces with other third party services used by the Data Rights Owner.&nbsp; To the extent that the Data User becomes aware that a significant proportion of its Data Rights Owner customers are relying on the same third party services, the Data User might establish more standardized interfaces to accommodate one or more of such third party service providers.&nbsp; Consider whether to provide, in this or another provision, for the Data Rights Owner that is receiving the services to be enabled to select one or more third party service providers that will be used by Data Rights Owner to enjoy the Services, or by Data User to provide the services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the equivalent of an ISP&rsquo;s relationship to a telecom provider in the early Internet days.&nbsp; It will ultimately be advantageous to all parties for the Data User to provide this &ldquo;hookup&rdquo; function to a variety of external services.&nbsp; It is not possible to discern, at present, what services will be external but functionally &ldquo;contiguous&rdquo; to the Data User function, and which will be part of that function, so this section will require further review and consideration.]</p>

<p>[NOTE:&nbsp; The intention of this section, and the reason for including it in the Agreement is that, from a commercial perspective (which helps attract resources to develop systems to support Data Rights Owner-friendly rights) the CESL process is a form of product development for future ESLs which are in turn a process for product development for Services.&nbsp; From a theoretical perspective, the CESLS can be seen as an early warning system of new and emerging Data Rights Owner Needs.&nbsp; If the process of addressing those needs is not correlated with this Agreement, and modifications thereof, then there will be no &ldquo;cross talk&rdquo; between the Agreement and emerging Data Rights Owner needs.&nbsp; This will increase the rate of Agreement ossification, and decrease the useable life of the arrangements set forth in the Agreement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This section seeks to address that problem by creating a process to &ldquo;mine the market externality.&rdquo;&nbsp; The process recruits Data Rights Owners as part of the product and service development chain by providing them with a vehicle to assert their needs.&nbsp; If a sufficient number of Data Rights Owners (or their market representatives) make similar assertions, Data Users in the commercial and governmental sectors will have a way of receiving the assertions and acting on them using the Agreement as a &ldquo;new issues landing strip.&rdquo;&nbsp; Note regarding MIT Kerberos presentation materials on Entropy Accounting, this is a process to mine the &ldquo;Godelian externality&rdquo; in an effort to reduce risk within the &ldquo;regulated market&rdquo; that is carried on within the bounds of the Agreement.&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[lix] Consider whether the standard Data User Agreement should present a form to make such CESLSs easy to request.&nbsp; Again, this can be advantageous from a &ldquo;market research&rdquo; perspective for Data Users.&nbsp; CESLSs provide Data Users with a source of &ldquo;market research&rdquo; since trends in CESLS requests can reveal emerging Data Rights Owner needs as Service customers.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[lx] Query whether the dispute resolution and other similar provisions of this Agreement should be deemed to apply to any CESLS.&nbsp; On the positive side, such alignment of terms with this Agreement will help engender greater legal interoperability, which has multiple benefits of cost reduction and the breadth of rights realization across greater populations of Data Rights Owners as a result of binding a greater number of Data Users.&nbsp; On the negative side, the dispute resolution and other &ldquo;boilerplate&rdquo; provisions of the main Agreement are not generic, but are designed and drafted to create specific supports, incentives and penalties for Registered Parties.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the CESLS are anticipated to be developed after the parties have become Registered Parties (prior to which they wouldn&rsquo;t be bound to this Agreement and so the CESLS requirements would be meaningless).&nbsp; The CESLS relationship to the Agreement requires further discussion and development before it is finalized.&nbsp; In the meantime, the section can be reserved and the existing text deleted until such time as the provisions are completed.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[lxi] Consider the scope of integration of third party services as part of the Data User Services.&nbsp; There may be situations where Data User will desire to handle aspects of the administration, customer relationship, billing and other aspects of the third party services in order to offer the most effective customer experience to its Data Rights Owner customers.&nbsp; This might include various &ldquo;white label&rdquo; arrangements, billing &ldquo;on behalf of&rdquo; arrangements, coordination of help desk functions, etc.&nbsp; If and to the extent that any such relationships develop, consideration should be given to documenting them in this Agreement.&nbsp; For example, to the extent that third party supplier of services will be needed by Data Rights Owner, and will be billed through Data User on behalf of Data Rights Owner, the following provisions should be considered.&nbsp; Also, consider whether such third party services will be separately invoiced to Data Rights Owner, or will be included in Data User overhead.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[lxii] This last section is meant to indirectly provide Data Rights Owners under CESLSs with a mechanism for price adjustment when an aspect of their CESLS is picked up by the Data User as a part of their regular Service.&nbsp; There is no fee recapture to the Data Rights Owner for the change, but future fees may be offset by the benefit enjoyed by the Data User when it offers the CESL services to other Data Rights Owners.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[lxiii] &nbsp;Consider insertion of cross-reference to external security standards to track here.&nbsp; In effect, such a normative cross-reference would incorporate such standards by reference into the Service standards of the Data User.&nbsp; That approach may be desirable for scaled systems if one or more appropriate standards can be identified for normative cross reference]</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[lxiv] In this section 7.1 an attempt is made to balance transparency and accountability of security operations relating to de-identification with the responsibility of Data Users that de-identify data to not assist in its re-identification.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[lxv] Note that violations of security will need to be remedied through a combination of Agreement processes and existing law, and will need to be refined and discussed.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[lxvi] Note that data that is &ldquo;relatable to&rdquo; a Data Rights Owner includes Circulating Data, since that can be re-identified (for example through combination with other data, or when examined from an alternative context) into Vault Data, and thus appears &ldquo;relatable to&rdquo; a Data Rights Owner.&nbsp; Since Data Rights Owner does not have IP and proprietary rights to such Circulating Data, it is not included in this reference.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The question of whether Data Rights Owners has one or more forms of &ldquo;fundamental rights&rdquo; in Circulating Data should be explored.&nbsp; To the extent that Data Rights Owners are deemed to retain &ldquo;strings&rdquo; on Circulating Data that has not been re-identified into Vault Data, the value of data leverage, big data, etc. will not be realized.&nbsp; This is different than acknowledging that Data Rights Owners have rights in Vault Data that has been re-identified from Circulating Data; the challenge is to permit the free flow of Circulating Data for leverage benefits, but to have the Data Rights Owner&rsquo;s rights &ldquo;spring&rdquo; into being upon the act of re-identification by a Data User.&nbsp; At that point, the contract would call that to be, simultaneously with the achievement of such re-identification, &ldquo;Vault Data.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Data User, having engaged in the act of re-identifying Circulating Data into Vault Data, would be subject to the terms of the Agreement that relate to Vault Data.&nbsp; Those duties shift automatically and instantaneously under the Agreement.&nbsp; This is why it has to be a condition precedent that all transferees of both Vault Data AND Circulating Data become Registered Parties; the Agreement recruits them to perform the duties of warehousemen for the data system that the Agreement documents.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[lxvii] &nbsp;This is an important part of the economic model for this Data User form.&nbsp; It is anticipated that multiple Data Users will use this form of Agreement or another similar form.&nbsp; Just as banks (in &ldquo;normal times&rdquo;) compete for customer deposits by paying the highest interest (and other service competitive differentiations), this system is designed so that Data Users compete for Service customers by &ldquo;paying&rdquo; (whether by money, service credits, etc.) the highest amounts for their use of de-identified data (aka &ldquo;Circulating Data&rdquo;).&nbsp; This business model is not that far from that of most current social networks (that &ldquo;pay&rdquo;&rdquo; for data with the provision of desirable services.&nbsp; It does, however, permit a greater granularity and refinement in the structuring of the exchange (with corresponding efficacy gains for Data Rights Owners, and a positive feedback loop that liberates more data to be shared in the system.&nbsp; It is a model that supports growth in the data based economy AND is intended to be structured so that the benefits of that growth are more equitably shared throughout the supply chain.</p>

<p>By this mechanism, people can &ldquo;shop&rdquo; for the place where &ldquo;privacy&rdquo; (aka &ldquo;online identity integrity&rdquo;) is provided to them most effectively, in a way that best suits their respective needs and at the best rate for the type of data and identity services in which they are interested.&nbsp; Because data portability is one of the core Services, Data Rights Owners can &ldquo;shop&rdquo; for the best deal (and avoid the Data Users who unjustly exploit Data Rights Holders through subtle forms of mis-appropriation sometimes masked in notice and consent style presentation of terms, just as depositors can move money from one bank to another.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[lxviii] &ldquo;Reasonable Permitted Access&rdquo; should be a defined term to help clarify the appropriate circumstances for Data User access to Vault Data to prevent abuses of such &ldquo;Administrative Access.&rdquo;&nbsp; There are many circumstances in which the scope of such access will be a question.&nbsp; For example, recall that in the U.S. there is an &ldquo;administrative search&rdquo; exception to the 4<sup>th</sup> Amendment proscription on warrantless search and seizure.&nbsp; Query of the status and responsibilities of a governmentally-contracted, private data system administrator looking at Vault Data for operational purposes, who detects a data correlation signature associated with a particular criminal activity.&nbsp; This issue won&rsquo;t ever go away, and it should be handled in a way that provides parties with more certainty so that it does not lead to the impression that government officials have unfettered discretion to access data, an impression that can put chronic and debilitating pressure on the fabric of society.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[lxix] Just as bank depositors who maintain a minimum balance in their checking and savings accounts were historically not required to pay for certain banking services such as safety deposit boxes, so too does the leverage from use of Circulating Data pay for Vault Data services.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also like banking services, there is the opportunity for Data Rights Owners to receive value from the Vault Data that they share with a Data User, through the accounting/sharing structure of the Agreement which normalizes and renders predictable: (i) the mechanism of de-identification of Vault Data and transfer of Circulating Data by Data User for compensation, and (ii) the generation of fees by Data Users, in the nature of agency commissions, for the Services associated with transfers of Vault Data on behalf of Data Rights Owners (such as in the case of the use of Vault Data to inform relying parties in the case of its use to provide assurance in an identity credentialing setting.</p>

<p>[NOTE: There are potential tax &ldquo;whipsaw&rdquo; implications associated with payment netting in those contexts where taxes are applied based on &ldquo;gross receipts&rdquo; or other &ldquo;cascading&rdquo; settings. &nbsp;It may be helpful in avoiding unintended tax results to re-characterize the payment provisions as cost or payment reductions, rather than &ldquo;netting&rdquo; or payments owed so that the original obligations never technically arise, which may help to avoid this consequence.]</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[lxx] The economic model that is the engine for the structure documented in this Agreement is based on data leverage (i.e., enabling the use (to generate valuable &ldquo;inform-ation&rdquo;) by multiple parties of a single piece of data through structured management so that such use is consistent with the needs of the data subject and all other parties).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Data cannot be leveraged until it is made available to the system (just as a $1 bill under someone&rsquo;s mattress cannot be applied by a bank in the banking system to satisfy the reserve requirements that are preliminary to the leverage value created by fractional reserve lending).&nbsp; The data must be &ldquo;in the system&rdquo; (the &ldquo;accountable&rdquo; part of the system) and available for leverage to fuel the data leverage engine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Under the Agreement, this leverage is in turn a source of efficacy for individuals to achieve greater identity integrity in the global setting, where data about them is potentially beyond the reach of the sovereign from which much of the individual&rsquo;s traditional protection has been achieved.&nbsp; If data in which I have rights (whether fundamental, economic, contractual, etc.) is beyond the reach of the sovereign, from where can I derive protection?</p>

<p>The economic arrangements of this Data User agreement are intended to balance these social/power/economic associated with &ldquo;leverage&rdquo; and &ldquo;security&rdquo; considerations in an integrated fashion.&nbsp; For each party, it is a bit of giving here, getting there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For example, while the Agreement anticipates that the Data User will earn fees for the provision of Vault Data Warehousing (essentially &ldquo;cloud&rdquo; services) and other Services, it is recognized that the data acquisition and collection activity is foundational to the model, and advantages Data User sufficiently such that charging a collection fee to Data Rights Owners for this Service is not appropriate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In fact, to the extent that the goal of the Agreement is to achieve Data Rights Owner rights-establishment and perpetuation goals in the context of the preexisting Data User data &ldquo;gold rush&rdquo; there is little need to consider mechanisms for incentive for Data Users to engage in the activity of collecting data &ndash; they already do the collection pursuant to existing market incentives.&nbsp; By wrapping collection activity into the Agreement and calling it &ldquo;collection service,&rdquo; to be structured in an integrated fashion with the other data actions (aka &ldquo;Services&rdquo;) that enable the value realization that follows collection, it supports a more comprehensive view of the value flows in the Data Rights Owner relationship with Data Users, and enables a more balanced treatment in this document.&nbsp; This is because the collection activity is foundational to any use of data, and is currently unilaterally, but effectively, motivated by Data User intrinsic economic motivations &ndash; to date mostly in the advertising industry.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[lxxi] The &ldquo;cloud-based storage index&rdquo; does not yet exist (as far as I know), but can be calculated by taking the average of some benchmark prices from cloud service providers. The idea is to keep Data Users Services competitive with cloud service providers to the extent there is a functional overlap, and to prevent Data Rights Owners from getting taken advantage of by their acceptance of unclear &ldquo;tying arrangements&rdquo; and &ldquo;package pricing&rdquo; (such as that complained of by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) with respect to phone service billing &ldquo;cramming&rdquo; and other similar practices in other industries that can tend to obscure added and avoidable charges).&nbsp;</p>

<p>This &ldquo;normative cross reference&rdquo; to outside pricing can be considered an informal &ldquo;market index&rdquo; for data storage Services, and is intended to assure that Data Rights Owners pay no more or less to store data than they pay for cloud services associated with data storage.&nbsp; The distinction being that a Data User mix of services, unlike current cloud arrangements, has the capacity to generate &ldquo;data leverage&rdquo; by allowing the controlled third party access to Vault Data (with Data Rights Owner permission) and Circulating Data (without Data Rights Owner permission) which in turn generates credits that can be applied to cause the overall Data User service to be received without charge to Data Rights Owners.&nbsp; This &ldquo;two-way value flow&rdquo; is an advantage over cloud service providers and is more roughly analogous to individuals that sell electric power back to the grid to generate electrical service credits (sometimes earning a net payment back from the electric company).&nbsp; It is also grossly analogous to online service provision based on the current, narrower advertising model (such as employed by various online social networks and search and other services) where the consumer receives the service for &ldquo;free&rdquo; since the cost of the design, development and deployment of the service is covered by the revenues generated through the more narrow data leverage activities that take the form of online advertising.&nbsp; This Agreement anticipates a more detailed accounting for such value flows than is currently made available.&nbsp; At present, we are in a situation for data that is equivalent to a hypothetical banking system where banks provide services, but don&rsquo;t provide an periodic accounting in the form of a monthly statement.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[lxxii] These acknowledgements help establish the contractual elimination of restraints on alienation of Circulating Data that in turn enables the economic engine to pay for the costs of improving the privacy and security of Vault Data.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ability to transfer and use Circulating Data is not unfettered.&nbsp; In fact, it is tightly controlled under the Agreement because at the very moment that it ever becomes &ldquo;Vault Data&rdquo; (as defined in the Agreement) through whatever process or circumstance, the duties of a Registered Party in possession of such converting Circulating Data immediately (and without any action on the part of Data Rights Owner) convert from those of a Data User of Circulating Data to those of a Data User of Vault Data.&nbsp; This happens instantaneously as a &ldquo;springing duty.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In other words, the obligation of any Registered Party to perform services 1-4 instantaneously arises when any such party comes into possession of Vault Data (including when the Circulating Data that they possess or have access to is, in fact, Vault Data to them because of prior knowledge, special context, etc.)&nbsp; The word &ldquo;solely&rdquo; is included in (i) and (ii) in acknowledgement of the fact that Circulating Data might be used in ways that cause it to be &ldquo;re-identified&rdquo; into Vault Data.&nbsp; This separate re-identification event is outside the safe harbor available to Data Users.&nbsp; The &ldquo;springing duty&rdquo; can be imposed by contract or public law (legislation or regulation).&nbsp; The source of the duties is drafted here as an Agreement, in anticipation of its introduction in the U.S., where public legislation/regulation on these issues is not on the horizon (NSTIC, for example, is intended as a private sector initiative that will need to rely on private contract for documentation of the structure.&nbsp; Those same duties can, however, also be instituted across populations by public law in those jurisdictions or regions where that pathway is more readily available.</p>

<p>[lxxiii] The Agreement should have explicit provisions that prohibit the Data User from engaging in Data User Service activities in a way that is not reflective of good faith dealing.&nbsp; For instance, the safe harbor and the fee structure should not apply if there was improper de-identification activity (as tested against the objective criteria set forth in Schedules).&nbsp; Similarly, the safe harbor and fee structure should not apply if a Data User transfers Circulating Data to a third party knowing that the third party plans to re-identify the data into Personal Identifying Information.&nbsp; Consider whether those provisions should be included in this section, a schedule or a later section.&nbsp; Perhaps it would make sense to generate a schedule that would list activities that are prohibited as a &ldquo;Data User Code of Conduct.&rdquo;&nbsp; That code of conduct would offer refinements to the duties of the Agreement as new &ldquo;work around&rdquo; strategies are discovered through which Data Users try to circumvent the Agreement terms for unfair advantage.&nbsp; The Code of Conduct could be updated by contract modification processes.</p>

<div id="edn">
<p>[lxxiv] Consider including a schedule that establishes parameters for the calculation of direct and indirect costs and Data User profit.&nbsp; The intention is that Data Users can charge what they want, but need to be transparent about pricing and account to Data Rights Owners for their contribution to that profit.&nbsp; Data Rights Owners can then more effectively &ldquo;shop&rdquo; for solutions, comparing &ldquo;apples to apples&rdquo; pricing across Data User offerings.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[lxxv] These financial terms are crafted to establish a set of interdependencies among the Registered Parties that can be measured with familiar monetary metrics.&nbsp; It is anticipated that the &ldquo;net/net&rdquo; of these calculations will cause the overall suite of Services to be provided at no &ldquo;out of pocket&rdquo; cost to the Data Rights Owner, and that no Data Rights Owner would be required to pay for Data Vault Warehousing Services (unlike the &ldquo;bank model&rdquo; where the bank charges a service fee for safety deposit box usage).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The model in the Agreement is that Data Rights Owners &ldquo;pay&rdquo; for vault services but that Data Users generate two streams of income, the sharing of which with Data Rights Owner will offset the latter&rsquo;s Service cost.&nbsp; First, the Data User earns &ldquo;agency&rdquo; commissions for sharing Vault Data for and on behalf of Data Rights Owners.&nbsp; Second, the Data User generates revenue from the sharing, for its own account, of de-identified data (Circulating Data).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Agreement is structured as a paid service, like electricity, phone service, cable television, but such Service charges are netted against revenue received by the Data User for its use of data.&nbsp; This structure encourages data leverage, by letting people control third party data use, but earning more fees the more they let data that is rendered innocuous (Circulating Data) be used.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall it creates incentive (free service and possible payments) to participate more, but still permits everyone&rsquo;s &ldquo;privacy thermostat&rdquo; to be set wherever they want.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note that the business model does not stand alone in every case.&nbsp; The model described above in this note is for a stand-alone Data User.&nbsp; Note that in the situation where there is an underlying business relationship, such as the provision of Telco services, healthcare services, banking or financial services, retail transactions and the like, the provider of the underlying services may choose to provide Data User services &ldquo;in house,&rdquo; or through a subsidiary, or to affiliate with a captive or independent Data User service provider.&nbsp; In each of these latter instances, the economics of the Data User Services do not stand alone, and could function as competitive differentiators for the services offered within those other markets.&nbsp; This represents the conversion of traditional &ldquo;customer relations management&rdquo; systems to new, independent markets, in much the same way as the standardization and modularization of software permitted its detachment from hardware into an independent market, and the standardization and modularization of derivatives (as insurance products written on underlying monetary and financial transactions) permitted their vast expansion (leading to the overexpansion that &ldquo;popped&rdquo; in 2008).&nbsp; This Agreement seeks to standardize and modularize data services (and in particular those involving data that can be used to create so-called &ldquo;personal information&rdquo; so that data markets can enjoy the same expansion (but in a more measured and equitable fashion to the advantage of all stakeholders).</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[lxxvi] Insert cross-reference to the subset of costs for which Data User will be liable.&nbsp; Also, check to be sure this is consistent with the earlier third party cost sharing provision, and not duplicative once all such third party services are identified.</p>

<p>[lxxvii] If the &ldquo;benefit corporation&rdquo; form is chosen for the data User entity (as might be recommended as a way of &ldquo;internalizing&rdquo; the &ldquo;two sided market&rdquo; (aka conflicts between shareholders and customers) inherent in corporate ownership structures), this section can be revisited to provide additional structure for the Data Rights Owner&rsquo;s audit and information rights to accord with the relevant benefit corporation statute and the dispute resolution structures under those state &ldquo;benefit corporation&rdquo; statutes.</p>

<p>[NOTE: this section will be modified to provide for online reporting and querying of account meta data by Data Rights Owners, but those systems have yet to be configured.&nbsp; This is a placeholder]</p>

<div id="edn">
<p>[lxxviii] This is one of the provisions that establishes the &ldquo;radical transparency&rdquo; that is supportive of the trust needed to engage in these Services.&nbsp; By making this Agreement structure radically transparent, it may help to take the pressure off of Data Users to reconfigure their legacy operations to achieve such transparency, at least to the extent that the structure of the Agreement can be laid on top of existing operations.&nbsp; As long as the transparency is present in the parts of the overall integrated system being measured (the ones that count for checking on conformity with Agreement duties), that is sufficient.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a potential benefit to Data Users who are tied to regulatory regimes that are compulsory (HIPAA, GLB, FERPA, etc.), or are embedded in industries where standard form agreements are effectively compulsory (commodities exchanges, established supply chains, etc.), and therefore cannot unilaterally alter their internal operations to conform to all Agreement terms directly.&nbsp; In those cases, it is possible to conceive of intermediaries to which the duties of this Agreement can be &ldquo;outsourced.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="#_ednref" name="_edn81" title="">[lxxxi]</a> This tax section needs to be revisited in light of the strong anticipation that there will not be a payment flow from Data Rights Owners to Data Users under this Agreement (any more than there is an out-of-pocket payment by bank customers to their banks).&nbsp; It is strongly disfavored (and probably un-administrable) to structure the arrangements so that there is a tax payment to be made without a corresponding payment flow.</p>

<p>[lxxxii] The following section is intended to enable multiple Data Rights Owners to get together to contest a tax imposed on services.&nbsp; This is not an assertion against the Data User, but against taxes levied in various jurisdictions that are assessed on or with respect to the Services.&nbsp; This provides a mechanism to help change the external legal/tax landscape in which the Services are performed.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[lxxxiii] &nbsp;Consider other potential relevant benchmarking metrics that can help to inform Data Rights Owners.</p>

</div>

<div id="edn">
<p><a href="#_ednref" name="_edn84" title="">[lxxxiv]</a> Think of this section as a form of modified &ldquo;liquidated damages&rdquo; for various identified problems.&nbsp; It is only the subset of system performance issues that are addressed through ESLs that are the subject of potential fee reductions under this section.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The reason to have this program is to seek to reduce potential dispute resolution scaling problems.&nbsp; Under an &ldquo;80/20 rule&rdquo; type of generalization, it is likely that Data Rights Owner complaints about system performance will &ldquo;cluster&rdquo; around certain issues that will tend to repeat (i.e., 80 percent of the disputes are likely to be about 20% of the issue, etc.).&nbsp; Over a very large population, these dispute issues will tend to dominate administration of the System.&nbsp; Failure to quickly and efficiently address complaints will undermine the system, and the reliability and &ldquo;trust&rdquo; that needs to be engendered for system adoption and growth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If a subset of such dominant system performance failure issues can be dealt with through modest fee adjustments, the provision of credits and other direct approaches, it may be possible to reduce the potential resource load associated with dispute resolution, which is dealt with in a later section below.&nbsp; Also, modest fee reductions for modest issues will help to assure Data Rights Owners that they are getting fair value for the Services provided, and with a minimum of effort at enforcing their rights under the Agreement.&nbsp; Recent research reported in Science Magazine (see article on dispute resolution in Sierra Leone) confirms the efficacy of compensatory schemes for dispute resolution as opposed to fines and penalties structures.&nbsp; It also offers a pathway for the Services to continue to be provided notwithstanding problems under an ESL, since a Data Rights Owner can decide to continue to accept the fee reduction as compensation for any inconvenience that they experience, or to terminate the Agreement with a particular Data User (or even to exploit their data portability rights, in their sole discretion.&nbsp; Termination may be too blunt an instrument of recourse, particularly where a Data Rights Owner is economically or otherwise dependent on the service.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[lxxxv] Consider whether to include a comparative or contributory negligence concept for situations where a system problem is caused by actions of both Data User and Data Rights Owner.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[lxxxvi] Following approval of services and payments descriptions, this section will be drafted to provide for netting of payments.&nbsp; The intention is that the Services will be provided to Data Rights Owners without the necessity for them to be &ldquo;out of pocket.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Data Users make money (like banks) from receiving &ldquo;deposits&rdquo; (of data, rather than money) that they can use to create &ldquo;data leverage.&rdquo;&nbsp; If they generate enough value from data leverage, they don&rsquo;t need to charge anything for the other Services provided.&nbsp; In fact, if they can generate sufficient revenue from Circulating Data, they will be incentivized to provide other new services as &ldquo;loss leaders&rdquo; much like Telcos give away phones if a customer signs up for a long term contract.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notably, once Vault Data is distinguished from Circulating Data, it becomes possible to generate revenue from Circulating Data, which is de-identified, in an amount that is sufficient to offset costs of providing Data Vault Warehouse services.&nbsp; Thus, it is possible that the system can preserve privacy (in the form of unshared Vault Data), while still allowing for data leverage (in the form of revenue generated from shared, de-identified Circulating Data).&nbsp;</p>

<p>One intended function of the Agreement is to provide the basic legal &ldquo;engine block&rdquo; for an economic engine to enable big data with privacy.&nbsp; In fact, big data pays for privacy services in this model. The paradox that is sought to be resolved in the Agreement is that people will have greater privacy by sharing more data.&nbsp; This is done by recognizing the distinction between data and information (see Shannon), and using the already-established expedient of de-identification processes, and the assignment of uniform duties across populations to create a new economic &ldquo;space&rdquo; in which the paradox can be resolved; and can in fact generate new value and new markets that can foster overall economic growth in a variety of industries and sectors.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[lxxxvii] The &ldquo;cause to make available&rdquo; language anticipates that the vast majority of Data Users will be individuals receiving Vault Data from friends on social networks, etc. &nbsp;The innocent question &ldquo;can you keep a secret&rdquo; is now a more formal inquiry for those who share personal information over distributed and increasingly interconnected social networks where (as a commercial matter) the customers are the advertisers (since they pay for service), and the users and their interactions are the &ldquo;object of interest&rdquo; (&ldquo;product&rdquo;) to those customers.&nbsp; This business model is identical to that of network television business model evolved in the 1960s, which treat viewers, somewhat disconcertingly (but tellingly), as the &ldquo;product.&rdquo;&nbsp; The paradigm of &ldquo;people as products&rdquo; is the opposite of the efficacy that is intended to be engendered by this Agreement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The question is whether such purported &ldquo;efficacy&rdquo; can be converted into the enjoyment of real rights by real people.&nbsp; One challenge is that, even if they want to &ldquo;do the right thing&rdquo; to help others, those individual Registered Parties acting as Data Users will have little or no capacity to discharge their complex and resource intensive obligations as Data Users under this Agreement without the assistance of intermediary entities.&nbsp; It is anticipated that individual Registered Parties acting as Data Users will seek assistance from commercial intermediaries who can represent their interests with greater leverage that one individual could manifest alone.&nbsp; There are myriad examples of how individuals depend on intermediaries to navigate complex social and commercial contexts.&nbsp; This assisted, group leverage can be very roughly analogized to &ldquo;selling co-operative&rdquo; forms of organization, where groups of transferees of value (such as the valuable data involved here) get together to increase their market power and negotiating leverage.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[lxxxviii] Consider whether to combine this reporting provision with the other reporting provisions in the Agreement.&nbsp; Check for overlap of the provisions and resolve.&nbsp; The report is important for Data Rights Owners to be able to exercise their authority not just as consumers of Data User Services, but also as producers of data that feeds the industries supported with Circulating Data (aka &ldquo;big data&rdquo;) and Shared Vault Data.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[lxxxix] Personnel requirements will be applicable primarily to institutional Data Users, provided that individual Data Users will also need to be held to standards of care that will enable them to be accountably reliable under the Agreement.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[xc] Clearly individual Registered Parties acting as Data Users will not be hiring staff.&nbsp; The message to individual Registered Parties who sign the Agreement to receive the rights as Data Rights Owners is that they should NOT engage in the activities of a Data User that they cannot handle, or that they should engage in those activities through intermediaries (imagine cloud providers who hold data on behalf of Data Rights Owners and help them to discharge their Services as Data Users under the Agreement, much as banks take deposits and combine them together to create loans to commercial and residential third parties &ndash; it is assisted leverage).&nbsp; In other words, they should not transfer Vault Data, etc. in violation of the Agreement terms.&nbsp; This may seem harsh, but the ultimate system reliability requires some level of conformity to Data Action standards by all Registered Parties.&nbsp; If individuals want to achieve contractual rights under the Agreement, they also need to act (with or without intermediary assistance) in a way that is consistent with the rights of others by performing their Data Actions consistent with the duties of Data Users (which they clearly are) under the Agreement.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[xci] This sentence establishes the Agreement level of expertise as the base level across jurisdictions and sectors and reflects an attempt to establish a subsidiary set of standards for Data Users&rsquo; outsourcing of Data Actions to other parties.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[xcii] The bracketed language raises the interesting question of scope of conditions to being a Registered Party.&nbsp; An institutional Registered Party must register once, but what about its employees, independent contractors, etc. who act on its behalf.&nbsp; It is suggested that system reliability will be enhanced if institutional Registered Parties are required to cause their employees to be Registered Parties in their individual capacities as well as a condition of employment.&nbsp; This might be easier to achieve in those jurisdictions where the duties under this Agreement are imposed by law or regulation (so that the &ldquo;compulsion&rdquo; comes from law, not as a condition of employment, which might be disfavored in some jurisdictions).&nbsp; See section 9.5 for requirement of employees becoming Registered Parties.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[xciii] &nbsp;To what extent will it be necessary to account for Data Rights Owners policies?&nbsp; Individual human Data Rights Owners are unlikely to have such policies.&nbsp; Also, will it be necessary for Data User employees to ever gain access directly to a Data Rights Owner&rsquo;s system or equipment?&nbsp; If so, consider provisions relating to creating a default &ldquo;Data Rights Owner&rdquo; policy.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[xciv] There is much to discuss on this issue.&nbsp; One point is the issue of &ldquo;residuals&rdquo; as described in non-disclosure agreements.&nbsp; How much &ldquo;knowledge&rdquo; can be restricted from moving with a person, including knowledge that relates to Vault Data to which they were exposed as an employee.&nbsp; This issue is not new.&nbsp; Compare the legal, ethical and normative limitations on legal secretaries and nurses who leave the employ of a law firm or hospital, respectively regarding client and patient confidences and other similar settings.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[xcv] Consider whether to expand this concept to include a &ldquo;default setting&rdquo; for minimum intrusion that would be the functional equivalent to a data collection minimization, but extended to the new concept of data use limitation (as opposed to the pre-hyper-networked concept of data collection limitation &ndash; a concept rendered anachronistic by the sheer volume of information collected, and other factors).&nbsp; That concept might be that, when accessing Data Rights Owner data, Data User should not exceed the bounds of what is necessary to achieve its current authorized purpose, etc.&nbsp; Consider challenges of issues such as &ldquo;plain view&rdquo; and &ldquo;administrative search&rdquo; in U.S. Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, but in this expanded (non-evidentiary, commercial) context.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[xcvi] Although this section anticipates that Data User will assist, it does not indicate which party is ultimately responsible for such compliance.&nbsp; This probably needs to be parsed out a bit, since there might be multiple compliance responsibilities for any given data or data set.&nbsp; The ultimate responsibility may be separately allocated for each.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[xcvii] Consider whether the generation of metadata by Data User might be considered to be handled something like &ldquo;work product&rdquo; in traditional service agreements where IP is produced. This section is drafted consistent with that approach, but the analogy should be more thoroughly considered before finalization.&nbsp; Care should be exercised to make certain that the &ldquo;property&rdquo; metaphor of IP law does not unduly intrude on the analysis to the detriment of scaling considerations.&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[xcviii] The inclusion of the &ldquo;assignable&rdquo; concept touches on the question of what portion of Vault Data rights are &ldquo;fundamental,&rdquo; and therefore not assignable, under foundational concepts of law such as the EU data directive and its related authorities, the U.S. Constitution&rsquo;s First Amendment, which protects &ldquo;data flow&rdquo; rights in the form of &ldquo;freedom of expression&rdquo; (data output channel), and freedom of access to information, assembly (data input channel), and other sources.&nbsp; Note that the first amendment argument is an area of research that is still nascent and novel (in fact it still invites a few snickers from colleagues), but is consistent with the work of Shannon, Erving Goffman, Douglas Hofstadter and others that acknowledge the flows and feedback loops of information in social contexts that seem to be the source of the types of risks and value propositions emerging in online social networks and larger data network settings.</p>

<p>Related to the fundamental rights issue, but from a fourth amendment rather than a first amendment perspective (since the two seem to be assumed (perhaps too loosely) to be interchangeable in the current popular privacy conversation), and as evidence of the timeliness of this issue, the current U.S. NSA programs were declared to be based on the legal authority of a &ldquo;business records&rdquo; exception in fourth amendment jurisprudence.&nbsp; In <u>U.S. v. Miller</u> (1976)(bank records of illegal alcohol &ldquo;moonshiner&rdquo;) and in <u>Smith v. Maryland</u> (1979)(phone records of criminal &ldquo;stalker&rdquo;), the U.S. Supreme Court provided that there is no &ldquo;reasonable expectation of privacy&rdquo; (<u>Katz</u> case) in such &ldquo;business records.&rdquo;&nbsp; The bank and the phone company respectively had authorized access to such records, so that there is no &ldquo;reasonable expectation of privacy&rdquo; in such records.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Justice Holmes [check] once observed in another context, however, &ldquo;Just because one has the right to do something, doesn&rsquo;t mean that it is right to do something.&rdquo;&nbsp; Perhaps the 4<sup>th</sup> amendment was not intended to be the foundation for the entire &ldquo;information relationship&rdquo; of the government with its entire citizenry, but instead was intended to afford protections from data/identity intrusion only in those cases where a particular citizen was already the focus of suspicion (note that this line may inform the distinction of &ldquo;collection&rdquo; and &ldquo;use&rdquo; in both intelligence operations and the commercial context, where big data is frequently a code word for &ldquo;secondary use of data&rdquo;).&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is an interesting fundamental question of whether the constitutional protections that provide an absolute floor for the protection of criminals is the most appropriate basis upon which to create an aspirational goal for interaction with all citizens.&nbsp; It is a well developed standard, and it does have the word &ldquo;privacy&rdquo; in it, so it is a natural candidate for consideration.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it may represent a setting in which the concept is hijacked by the metaphor.&nbsp; The word &ldquo;privacy&rdquo; was relied upon in the Katz case context for purposes of parsing an evidentiary admissions issue under the fourth amendment, not the context of the way that the work &ldquo;privacy&rdquo; is used today.&nbsp; &ldquo;Privacy&rdquo; in current parlance is a rubric for a whole host of emerging harms, most of which are undefined because their precise natures are not yet known.&nbsp; Some of these are just anxieties about institutional change, for which there will ultimately not be a legally cognizable claim, but others represent fundamental shifts in real risk profiles for individuals in both commercial, social and governmental contexts, for which legal protections will need to be created.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The question is what legal sources form the precedent for such legal constructions.&nbsp; Does applying the &ldquo;default setting&rdquo; for the system at the level set by the fourth amendment tend to criminalize a population?&nbsp; One way out of the subjectivity/tautology of line drawing is to recognize that it is increasingly becoming the case that everyone has access to more and more data.&nbsp; I often say, without actual support, that my children have access to more raw information than Bill Clinton did as president (not the same information, perhaps, but accessible information is swamping fenced information).&nbsp;</p>

<p>[RESEARCH NOTE:&nbsp; Perhaps access to data is not the question, but rather what is done with it?&nbsp; Shannon helps here.&nbsp; Note, however, the &ldquo;mosaic&rdquo; arguments in 4<sup>th</sup> amendment context and the &ldquo;panopticon&rdquo; problem, that a citizenry that is pervasively surveilled is not in fact free.&nbsp; See Foucault &ldquo;Pastoral Control&rdquo; here (concept of internalization of sets of external rules, laws, norms, expectations, etc.) &nbsp;How might these concepts of internalizing external rules be applied when, in effect, everyone has access to data about everyone?&nbsp; What happens to game theory when, for example, in the prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma situation, the &ldquo;prisoners&rdquo; have the same information as the &ldquo;guards.&rdquo;&nbsp; The behaviors change to reflect the absence of an information differential.&nbsp; What are the institutional constructs that will emerge for &ldquo;governance&rdquo; of these settings (See Shiping Tang &ldquo;General theory of institutional change&rdquo; (concept of institutional change as conversion of &ldquo;ideas&rdquo; into &ldquo;institutions.&rdquo;).&nbsp; Note that the erasure of information differentials yields an equivalence of information that is thermodynamically &ldquo;isothermal,&rdquo; and no work can be performed by the system (aka there is no &ldquo;arbitrage&rdquo;).&nbsp; What is that nature of a system where all parties have access to identical information?&nbsp; How are so-called &ldquo;perfect markets&rdquo; supposed to generate value when information is instantaneously shared?&nbsp; How does this relate to the new &ldquo;hyper-trading&rdquo; activity, where nano-seconds are shaved by co-location of trading computers?&nbsp; What is the nature of market arbitrage, and how is its benefit being allocated in those hyper-technical contexts?&nbsp; How is value generated in the absence of information differentials in an &ldquo;isothermal&rdquo; situation?&nbsp; What is the nature of &ldquo;debt&rdquo; in those contexts, where debt is defined simultaneously in monetary and social terms. See, Graeber &ldquo;Debt, the first 5,000 years&rdquo; Melville House Publishing 2012).&nbsp; What is the appropriate role of data network structuring with knowledge that the data infrastructure will be shared (like water and electricity) in commercial, social and governmental domains? How should the &ldquo;design parameters&rdquo; from each of these sectors (and their myriad subsectors) be weighted in&nbsp; establishing the structure?&nbsp; What is the role of markets as tools for solution discovery for such structure; and regulation in steering such markets?&nbsp; How can standard contacts help to bring together different markets where the proportion of market and regulatory steering might differ (such as the US and the EU)?]</p>

<p>Interestingly, subsequent efforts to parse the fourth amendment issue in the current mass surveillance context have focused on the distinction of data &ldquo;acquisition&rdquo; versus its subsequent &ldquo;analysis.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not coincidentally, these represent two different Data Actions under this Agreement.&nbsp; The application of Shannon&rsquo;s quantitative theory of information to the current controversy would be edifying, as it would distinguish between the NSA&rsquo;s initial <em>action of collection</em> of data (not yet Shannon &ldquo;Information&rdquo;), from the <em>subsequent act of analysis</em> (aka &ldquo;observation&rdquo; &ndash; Shannon&rsquo;s source of &ldquo;meaning&rdquo;).&nbsp; The legal challenges of considering separate warrant and subpoena processes (the two processes that iterate, in different contexts, from the fourth amendment) would be eased by application of Shannon&rsquo;s principles in the discussion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A full discussion of the implications of this analysis is well beyond even these lengthy notes, but suffice it to say that it is anticipated that a fully adopted version of this system contemplated by this Agreement would also include government entities as Registered Parties, and that the accounting offered by the system could readily be applied to help parse the rights and obligations in the fourth amendment context as it could in a commercial context.&nbsp; It is about rights and duties generally, and only a subset of those rights and duties (albeit the subset that powers the structure&rsquo;s adoption) is associated with commercial rights and duties.&nbsp; The idea is to use commercial energy to build structures that have broader benefit &ndash; a time-tested proposition; but one in which caution must be exercised against undue co-option of interests.&nbsp; (Re: co-option - see materials on network TV business model, note that sponsored art usually flatters the sponsors).</p>

<p>Back to the Agreement note: Metadata is typically collected by a party operating a system, where the data is a part of their information feedback system needed for operations.&nbsp; System managers need data to &ldquo;see&rdquo; those variables that affect their system.&nbsp; System metadata is therefore generated in a setting of &ldquo;shared interests&rdquo; that seems qualitatively different than the initial Vault Data that is not Metadata (and in fact is the basis of the &ldquo;business records&rdquo; exception in U.S. Fourth Amendment jurisprudence).&nbsp; This section of the Agreement seeks to parse that difference, by applying an analogy to assignable copyright work product.&nbsp; Query whether this analogy might be inappropriately viewed as establishing a property interest in data, which is not scalable, and doesn&rsquo;t reflect the fundamentals of information theory established by Shannon, etc.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[xcix] This section will be viewed as a substantial (and likely unacceptable) &ldquo;give&rdquo; by institutions that currently enjoy relatively unfettered access to and use of metadata.&nbsp; It is for this reason that the &ldquo;give&rdquo; needs to be evaluated in the context of benefits to such institutions gleaned under this Agreement structure.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the concept of empowerment of the Data Rights Owner is foundational to this Agreement.&nbsp; Note that this empowerment yields benefits to Data Users under this Agreement as well.&nbsp; At issue is the almost hypnotic power of the &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; concept, and the related concepts of an &ldquo;asset&rdquo; and a &ldquo;property interest&rdquo; that can be owned.&nbsp; Those concepts (even for tangible property) are pure legal imagination, of course (See Purdy&rsquo;s &ldquo;Property and the Legal Imagination&rdquo;), but are sufficiently ubiquitous that they seem to some to have been part of some natural law.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this Agreement that yearning for &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; is satisfied through the acknowledgement of a party&rsquo;s ability to own data <em>rights</em>, rather than being distracted by the ownership of &ldquo;data&rdquo; itself (which can be infinitely duplicated effectively undermining any &ldquo;property&rdquo; interest other than intangible &ldquo;rights&rdquo; in any event).&nbsp; Data ownership is a red herring (and one that is resulting in a really wasteful detour in data system structuring discussions).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just as a farmer owns water rights, but not the water itself, so too is it possible to own data rights, but not the data itself.&nbsp; In fact, it is difficult to conceive of how a property paradigm can be applied to the data itself that flows across a fully scaled Internet.&nbsp; It is like talking about the nitrogen content of my groceries as having been &ldquo;owned&rdquo; when I purchase the groceries.&nbsp; I do possess that nitrogen, but only briefly as metabolism runs its course.&nbsp; [RESEARCH NOTE:&nbsp; On that latter point, compare current efforts to establish &ldquo;carbon markets&rdquo; where an &ldquo;accounting system&rdquo; is, in fact, being established for the carbon content of other supply chains in recognition of its broader costs.&nbsp; Why not for nitrogen content?&nbsp; Why not for data content?&nbsp; Consider research on similarities of emerging Carbon and data markets as emerging &ldquo;supply chain&rdquo; risk meta metrics?&nbsp; In both cases, grossly speaking, there is a perceived cost/benefit mis-alignment that is sought to be corrected through a market mechanism.&nbsp; This Agreement is intended as a candidate for such a data market mechanism. END OF RESEARCH NOTE].&nbsp;</p>

<p>Regarding the &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; question, consider the idea of &ldquo;nominal ownership&rdquo; in leasing transactions, where the benefits of ownership such as depreciation and amortization of costs for tax and accounting purposes, tax credits and other benefits can be caused to be transferrable separate from the use of the asset (long term leasing, etc.).&nbsp; Here the Data Rights Owners &ldquo;ownership&rdquo; of the Vault Meta Data rights is acknowledged (and in fact made real by the Agreement itself), it is ownership of &ldquo;rights,&rdquo; not data.&nbsp; From the perspective of copyright interests being a &ldquo;bundle of sticks&rdquo; each of which is subject to separate assignment, license, etc., the copyright analogy is applied in this context, but not with the intention that the intellectual &ldquo;property&rdquo; nature of the metaphor be adopted for purposes of this Agreement.&nbsp; It will not scale, and would require strategies like ASCAP/BMI to keep up.&nbsp; Not coincidentally, those business structures are both instances of accounting, auditing, and payment functionality bolted onto copyright law, not unlike the accounting and auditing provisions of this Agreement that are proposed to be bolted onto emerging data markets.</p>

<div id="edn">
<p>[cv] The following termination sections are one of the last things that should be finalized in the Agreement.&nbsp; The determination of the desirable process and results of an unwinding of an element of the contract is clearly dependent on the nature of the affected element.&nbsp; Thus, these termination provisions are necessarily general, and their finalization is premature.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also, &ldquo;Termination&rdquo; of the Service should typically be a last resort. &nbsp;It is the equivalent of &ldquo;termination&rdquo; of electricity, or more aptly, &ldquo;TV&rdquo; services (cable, digital, online, etc.), where no &ldquo;gap&rdquo; in service is anticipated, but is of necessity typically tolerated by consumers.&nbsp; Thus, the suite of remedies made available to Data Rights Owners should be such that there are various intermediate levels of resolution possible before resort to &ldquo;termination&rdquo; and a &ldquo;data portability event&rdquo; is rendered necessary.&nbsp; Those &ldquo;stepped&rdquo; or &ldquo;escalating&rdquo; processes are not yet crafted in these draft provisions, since their precise configuration is dependent on the nature of the type of Service involved.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[cvi] Include rights of Data Rights Owner to terminate Service following &ldquo;change in control&rdquo; event of Data User to address the generic concerns arising from the control of Vault Data by a new entity.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[cvii] The termination provisions of this Agreement need more work, including consideration of the implications of termination in the context of a standard form agreement.&nbsp; Consider the payment card analogy, but here Registered Parties have dual roles.&nbsp; It would therefore seem that &ldquo;termination&rdquo; processes need to be made as easy as deciding not to shop at a store, etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Separate note:&nbsp; throughout this Agreement draft, I have included narrative as part of the contract text (in addition to providing footnotes).&nbsp; This is unorthodox in contract drafting, but is intentional here.&nbsp; The agreement draft at present is far too long to be a consumer-facing document.&nbsp; Like the credit card system, however, the consumer facing documents are relatively light, but that is the tip of the contract iceberg in payment card documentation.&nbsp; This draft Agreement is intended to anticipate both outputs, the consumer facing documentation and the background technical legal documentation and regulation, etc. The more &ldquo;narrative&rdquo; portions of the current Agreement draft would be anticipated to find their way into the consumer facing material.&nbsp;&nbsp; This paragraph is an example of that unorthodox narrative.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Separate note:&nbsp; This Agreement is designed as a standard form that is intended to be adopted with little or no modification across populations of Registered Parties to help define their dual roles as both Data Users and Data Rights Owners. &nbsp;Such broad adoption helps to establish the &ldquo;network effect&rdquo; of the broad risk reduction market that the Agreement was intended to carry into effect.&nbsp; Accordingly, the termination of this Agreement with respect to a particular Registered Party, in their capacity as either a Data Rights Owner or Data User will need to be handled in a manner that minimizes the negative impact on any other Agreement with any other Data Rights Owner.&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[cviii] The various termination scenarios will need to be worked through considering the community and payment card analogies.&nbsp; A party may want to remain in the &ldquo;system&rdquo; even if they don&rsquo;t have a relationship with every other Registered Party.&nbsp; Just as people share a currency, but don&rsquo;t all have a relationship with all banks or all stores, so too can people share data, but not have a relationship with every Registered Party.&nbsp; It will be important to consider how to effect a &ldquo;termination registry&rdquo; and how this affects the &ldquo;network effect&rdquo; of having all parties similarly bound.&nbsp; Will this impede the flow of data, since it will mean the inclusion of various legal &ldquo;valves&rdquo; to guide the flow?&nbsp; Do the technical permissioning systems of UMA (User Managed Access), XDI and others possibly help here?</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[cix] Note that data portability issues will need to be resolved along with the termination issues to sort out what happens to Vault Data when particular Registered Party relationships are terminated, but others continue.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[cx] Consider whether the actions will be different if the replacement data User provider is, or is not, one that provides its services based on this standard form of agreement.&nbsp; Where service providers do use the same form of agreement, it is likely that the Portability of Vault Data will be enhanced due to better &ldquo;legal interoperability.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[cxi] Consider whether to put an outside limit on the period during which the data portability actions will be taken (45 days?).&nbsp; What about exigent circumstances?&nbsp; Consider stepping of portability timing based on triage of data types?</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[cxii] Consider limitation on the transfer of these additional rights to enable a Data User to protect and maintain its interests in its &ldquo;special sauce,&rdquo; i.e., software and technology that is used with respect to the Vault Data, but is not &ldquo;necessary&rdquo; for such data to be used with a separate service.&nbsp; Also, consider how to make this possible with third party licenses.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[cxiii] This section seeks to create an operational version of the principle of the &ldquo;right to be forgotten.&rdquo;&nbsp; That right could, in an accountable system such as described in the Agreement, be realized with respect to a given institutional participant.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[cxiv] Query regarding the extent to which the Data User is responsible for recovering or seeing to the destruction of data shared with third parties with the consent of Data Rights Owner.&nbsp; There could be a requirement that Data User have in any contract with third parties a requirement that they destroy any Vault Data that they received.&nbsp; That destruction requirement would not apply to de-identified data (Circulating Data), since the Data Rights Owner control &ldquo;strings&rdquo; do not apply to such data.</p>

<p>If the decision is made to prohibit ANY transfer of Vault Data or Circulating Data to any party that has not signed the agreement (the &ldquo;viral&rdquo; provision), then that Data User party will be a member of the contract community, and as a participant in the market bound by this Agreement, could be assigned a direct, enforceable legal duty under the Agreement to delete data it had received from a Data User the relationship with which has been terminated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Separately, consider the effect of alternative technical and policy architectures (XDI, UMA, etc.) where there is no actual sharing of &ldquo;data&rdquo; per se, but rather the enablement of &ldquo;pointers&rdquo; and other mechanisms to provide permissioned access to data held in a virtualized &ldquo;Data User.&rdquo;&nbsp; In those cases, the Data User should not be required to destroy copies of data (a practice that was relevant with paper and other local storage), but rather to destroy any permissioned access links to such data. &nbsp;The language in the paragraph is intended to address these alternative architectures of permissioned access.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[cxv] The termination section will need to be revisited once the other provisions of the Agreement are closer to finalization.&nbsp; The challenge is to limit the effects of the &ldquo;termination&rdquo; to the relationship of the offending and harmed parties, but not to undermine the balance of the system.&nbsp; As this is a system that deals with non-rivalrous (duplicable) data, the disposition of the data is less at issue than the challenge of shaping the ability of the offending party to continue to participate in the structure contemplated by the Agreement following the default event.&nbsp; The preference should not be to kick someone off the system (except for certain types of offenses), but to try to repair and restore the system to maximum function following such challenges.&nbsp; Compensation, not punishment.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[cxvi] In the event of a material payment default, is there any situation in which a Data User could be given the equivalent of a &ldquo;Mechanic&rsquo;s lien&rdquo; or a &ldquo;Material-men&rsquo;s lien&rdquo; with respect to Vault Data to recover payment?&nbsp; Might this invite a form of digital serfdom, like the old mining town &ldquo;company store&rdquo; where the debt for provisions always exceeded the worker&rsquo;s pay?&nbsp; Perhaps that &ldquo;lien&rdquo; could be applied to the transferred Vault Data, and then &ldquo;discharged&rdquo; through serial payments made from the replacement data User service provider (perhaps similar to a court ordered garnishment of wages that are paid to the court and then to an aggrieved party?&nbsp; Consider data escrow arrangements that might be based on various software escrow structures used in current commercial practice.&nbsp; Should the defaulting Data Rights Owner have access to both Vault Data and Vault Meta Data, or just to Vault Data?</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[cxvii] This section has been prepared based on a more traditional set of provisions relating to insurance.&nbsp; It should be reviewed in light of currently-available (and rapidly evolving) insurance options relating to data collection, storage and handling.&nbsp; For individuals, might these coverages be appended to homeowner&rsquo;s or umbrella policies?&nbsp; Should certain levels of individual activity be statutorily exempt from certain types of claims?</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[cxviii] Include cross reference to other Data User undertakings here that protect the interests of Data Rights Owner, such as liquidated damages for ELS, indemnifications, etc.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[cxix] In an effort to encourage &ldquo;radical transparency,&rdquo; should the Agreement provide online access to relevant books and records of the Data User entity?&nbsp; Those entities that ran other businesses could create subsidiaries to house their Data User/Service operations, and thereby limit public access to non-Data User affiliate books and records, while still conforming to Data User record presentation requirements under the Agreement.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[cxx] Consider whether this records retention requirement will be inconsistent with the requirement that Vault Data and Vault Meta Data be deleted upon termination.&nbsp; If data will be required to be retained in order to inform such calculations, consider providing a &ldquo;carve out&rdquo; for the retention of such data as is needed solely for such purposes.&nbsp; In the alternative, consider whether &ldquo;permissioned access&rdquo; arrangements might better accommodate the paradox of data retention and destruction.&nbsp; If a Data User is in effect managing a permissioned access system, the arrangements could be made with the parties that hold the data to limit access to only those situations where Data User needed to exercise those limited rights.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[cxxi] Audit rights typically provide access related to physical books and records.&nbsp; Consider how this right might be updated to provide access to materials in an online &ldquo;inspection room&rsquo;&rdquo; or other presentation interface that enables controls for Data User records security similar to that available with respect to physical records.&nbsp;</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[cxxii] Consider including provision that imposes burden of costs of audit on Data User if the audit reveals a miscalculation that favors Data User in excess of a certain percentage.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[cxxiii] Query whether to characterize the relationship of the Data User to the Data Rights Owner as one of technical &ldquo;agency.&rdquo;&nbsp; If that path is taken, the scope and nature of the agency should be sufficiently defined in the Agreement and schedules that it does not vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in a way that undermines the consistency under the Agreement.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[cxxiv] It is anticipated that the Schedules will provide details of the Services, including those services associated with Data User&rsquo;s activity as an &ldquo;agent&rdquo; (with fiduciary obligations) with respect to Vault Data at the sole discretion of the Data Rights Owner.&nbsp; See forms of agreement for &ldquo;sales agency&rdquo; and &ldquo;publicity agency&rdquo; for analogous structures for Data Users as &ldquo;agents&rdquo; of Data Rights Owners in their capacities as data producers in data leverage settings.&nbsp; Those &ldquo;agency for leverage&rdquo; functions of the Data User are not yet detailed in the Agreement draft.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[cxxv] Given the fact that the Services under the Agreement could be described as an elaboration of a series of confidentiality arrangements entered into with respect to data about people (aka Vault Data), this section should be carefully re-crafted along with the ELS, insurance, and indemnity elements, all of which are intended to encourage reliable system operations, and to compensate Data Rights Owners for direct costs associated with system failures in a scalable, friction-less, and largely self-service escalation procedure, particularly since the volume of transactions is anticipated to produce a large volume of disputes at various levels.&nbsp; See materials from University of Massachusetts dispute resolution group (Ethan Katsch) for unpacking of levels of dispute to inform scaled escalation processes.&nbsp; Note that, as a result of their conformity to these standard, publicly available, rules, the functions of the Data User that are conformant to this Agreement will be quite transparent.&nbsp; This is unlike the payment card context where the background agreements are not publicly available, even to legal representatives of many of the stakeholders in those systems !).&nbsp;</p>

<p>There will hopefully be little about a given Data Users operations under this Agreement that is confidential other than the data it holds on people.&nbsp; This does not preclude Data Users from keeping their other operations confidential.&nbsp; It is like a bank with safety deposit function, i.e., no-one except the owner gets into the safety deposit box, but regulatory requirements make the bank obligated to reveal its operations results to regulators and others.&nbsp; Its methods and operations are not confidential, but the assets that it holds for third parties are.&nbsp; That paradigm seems helpful for conceiving of Data User Vault Data functions.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[cxxvi] &nbsp;Consider whether to base the duty of care on the standards and laws where Data Rights Owner resides, the latter is like the U.S. state data breach notice statutes.&nbsp; That latter requirement imposes a heavy burden of breach notice administration on Data Users that experience breach events, that is only slightly mitigated if the reporting requirements are relatively standardized.&nbsp; Note that jurisdictional issues are mitigated to the extent that a common contract form is used globally for the Data User functionality.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[cxxvii] See earlier notes relating to balance of destruction and records retention.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[cxxviii] Online service providers typically include additional provisions that protect from liability for various actions that are sometimes necessitated by external issues.&nbsp; Sometimes these provisions appear to reflect a &ldquo;take it or leave it&rdquo; attitude to contract negotiation that pervades the mass markets, but often the provisions have roots in the unyielding reality of trying to administer systems at scale.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Consideration should be given to including modified versions of a subset of these provisions in the Agreement to protect the Data User service so that it is able to perform in a commercially reasonable fashion, in balance with Data Rights Owner&rsquo;s needs.&nbsp; There needs to be a homeostatic balance of risk and liability potential for these Services to function at scale.&nbsp; For example, will Data User have the right to modify or suspend the Services without notice, or to interrupt operation for maintenance?&nbsp; Separately, can the Data User ever use Vault Data or Vault Meta Data without permission to investigate complaints about Data Rights Owner&rsquo;s use of the Services or in an effort to avoid injury to another party? Or to comply with legal process, regulation, etc.?&nbsp; Fraud protection?&nbsp; How about to act in good faith to protect the rights of other Data Rights Owners?&nbsp; What types of relief are available to Data User to prevent abuses of other Data Rights Owners?&nbsp; Can it seek injunctive relief?&nbsp; It will be useful to review sample &ldquo;terms of use&rdquo; for examples of these and other scenarios, and consider how more &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; terms such as these relating to operational issues can be updated and modified for application to Data User functionality.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[cxxix] Consider including a provision through which the Agreement can serve to protect the Data User owner from secondary liability due to Data Rights Owner bad or negligent actions.&nbsp; Are we entering a distributed architecture world of data where every party is (by the very nature of the distributed system) both a cloud service user and a cloud service provider?&nbsp; For example, if the Data Rights Owner places Vault Data with the Data User that carries copyrighted material that is infringing (a narrow instance), the Data User could be held liable as a secondary infringer for including that data in Shared Vault Data (since sharing will involve duplication of the data, which could constitute an infringement if the material were copyrightable) or Circulating Data (that might constitute a derivative work of the infringing Vault Data from which it was derived).&nbsp;</p>

<p>It may be useful to include the contract equivalent of U.S. DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) protection for the Data User, including such things as a Circulating Data &ldquo;take down on notice&rdquo; process to provide Data User with a safe harbor that can be administered at scale.&nbsp; Also, for protection for such other liability exposure as could result from defamation, hate speech, other prohibited speech, etc., it may be useful to have the contract equivalent of U.S. CDA (Communications Decency Act) coverage.&nbsp; The courts have interpreted the protection of the CDA broadly, and in a manner that would make direct narration of the CDA safe harbor too unwieldy for inclusion in the contract.&nbsp; Instead, the CDA and its authorities can be invoked as a &ldquo;normative cross reference&rdquo; in the Agreement, so that the coverage under the contract will &ldquo;track&rdquo; the coverage under current jurisprudence.&nbsp; In that way, the products and services made available in Data and Identity Markets will not be at a competitive disadvantage vis a vis similar information and identity products that enjoy coverage of the DMCA and CDA.&nbsp; The normative cross reference/tracking feature contractually mimics the statutory coverage as interpreted by the courts.&nbsp; It is like tracking stock, and it serves to help neutralize some of the difference between online service offerings.]</p>

<p>[cxxxv] The following is an attempt to saddle Data Users of Circulating Data with obligations to not re-identify such data, or if they do so, to be subject to the protection requirements of this Agreement.&nbsp; It can be best accomplished if all Shared Vault Data Users and Circulating Data Users are first required to register under this Agreement (and thereby become Registered Parties).&nbsp; If not, other non-privity mechanisms will need to be relied upon.&nbsp; These include certain &ldquo;executor&rdquo; contract models, EULA-type models, standard form intermediated models, and the like.&nbsp; The relative effectiveness of these models should be considered in light of the business terms discussion.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[cxxxvi] Other verbs here?</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[cxxxvii] Circulating Data is de-identified (&ldquo;high entropy&rdquo;) data.&nbsp; The particular type of de-identification protocol applied to create &ldquo;Circulating Data&rdquo; from &ldquo;Vault Data&rdquo; can vary under the Agreement to accommodate the particular requirements of a given jurisdiction, industry sector, or Existing Agreement.&nbsp; It is broadly recognized that properly de-identified data (Circulating Data) is not considered valuable, by itself, for identity assurance by Relying Parties, and is considered &ldquo;safe&rdquo; for sharing from a privacy perspective.&nbsp; An example of the current acceptance of this notion is found in HIPAA de-identified data that is currently eligible for sharing without permission of the patient.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Notwithstanding its lack of value for identity assurance purposes (absent re-identification activity by the Data User), de-identified data is broadly recognized to have potential value for other various &ldquo;big data&rdquo; applications and other situations where &ldquo;identification of Entities&rdquo; is not the motivating value proposition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By making Circulating Data available for such &ldquo;big data and other applications, Circulating Data can be a source of revenue for the Data User (the value of which it shares with Data Rights Owners).&nbsp; This data flow is enhanced under the Agreement since the transfer by the Data User of Circulating Data to third parties is done under a contractual &ldquo;safe harbor&rdquo; that protects the Data User from actions by Data Rights Owners for certain data-security-related harms in recognition of the break in the &ldquo;chain of causation&rdquo; of data&rsquo;s identity intrusion potential that results from the de-identification processes that precede sharing of Circulating Data with third parties.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note that where Circulating Data is brought together with other data in a way that &ldquo;re-identifies&rdquo; a person, that exercise of re-identification in effect re-creates &ldquo;Vault Data&rdquo; from such &ldquo;Circulating Data.&rdquo;&nbsp; At the point of such &ldquo;re-identification&rdquo; event, a party possessing such newly formed &ldquo;Vault Data&rdquo; is subjected to a &ldquo;springing duty&rdquo; to treat such Vault Data in accordance with this Agreement (assuming, of course, that they are parties to this Agreement &ndash; which may be a reason to limit transfers of Shared Vault Data and Circulating Data only to Observer Users who have agreed to be bound to the standard Agreement &ndash; it extends the duty of care &ldquo;container&rdquo; of the Data User to wherever the data flows).&nbsp;</p>

<p>If a particular jurisdiction wants to make such duties compulsory across populations (rather than waiting for people to join under the current voluntary &ldquo;opt-in&rdquo; model of the Agreement), the same duties can be imposed by statute or regulation.&nbsp; In the absence of such statute, the duties apply only to Parties that have decided to &ldquo;opt in&rdquo; and become Registered Parties using online registration processes.&nbsp; It is anticipated that, even if the entry into the Agreement is not a condition precedent to the receipt of data from a Data User, new parties will be encouraged to join this Agreement as a result of a form of gentle economic &ldquo;compulsion&rdquo; so that they can enjoy the benefits of access to greater quality and quantity of Vault Data from which they can &ldquo;mine&rdquo; Circulating Data (consistent with Entities interests), and the safe harbor for engaging in transfers of Circulating Data to third parties.]</p>

<p>[cxxxix] Upon a Data Portability Event, Data User is obliged to transfer Vault Data to Data Rights Owner or to another Data User of Data Rights Owner&rsquo;s choosing.&nbsp; Vault Data includes Vault Meta Data, and therefore Vault Meta Data must be transferred along with Vault Data.&nbsp; The reason for maintaining a distinction between general Vault Data and the subset of Vault Data that is called Vault Meta Data is that the Data User is NOT permitted to retain a copy of Vault Data following a Data Portability Event, other than that subset of Vault Data that is Vault Meta Data.&nbsp; This is necessary to enable a Data User to be audited, to provide accountings, etc. following a Data Portability Event.&nbsp; The Data User needs a copy of the Vault Meta Data as its transaction history with a particular Data Rights Owner in the event that it is called to account for any earlier interactions and transactions involving such data.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[cxl] This is where future &ldquo;Generally Accepted Entropy Accounting Standards&rdquo; (GAEAP) will come in.&nbsp; This is already a familiar exercise, although not yet generalized for application in a variety of data contexts.&nbsp; For example, HIPAA provides for circulation of de-identified data after processes to obscure identity in such data sets have been engaged in.&nbsp; The de-identified data that is sharable under HIPAA contains elements of what was PII when a Participant could be identified, but where identifying details have been obscured or removed by the manipulation of data in the set.&nbsp; At present there are varying techniques and protocols applied to achieve de-identification, depending on the type of data, the context, etc.&nbsp; It is expected that such approaches will initially require correlation to determine &ldquo;comparability&rdquo; from one system to another, and that ultimately the de-identification techniques will be normalized and standardized to enable greater system interoperability with regard to the determination of adequacy of de-identification and hence data flow and data flow controls.</p>
</div>

<div id="edn">
<p>[cxli] Under this Agreement, a pre-condition of such access, etc. is that Data User provides Services to Data Rights Owners with respect to Vault Data, and acts on its own behalf with respect to Circulating Data, all consistent with the duties and obligations set forth in this Agreement.&nbsp; The Services associated with Vault Data are in the nature of [agency][fiduciary] services rendered with respect to a protected Resource [owned and] controlled by a Data Rights Owner and designed, developed and deployed to reliably collect, hold, process and dispose of the Data Rights Owner&rsquo;s Vault Data. The Data Rights Owner controls access to use, modification, copying, derivative works, and redaction or deletion of the Vault Data they enter or make available to the Data User, including, without limitation, Vault Data entered based upon sensor data passively collected from the Participant&rsquo;s smartphone, and also including, without limitation, audio, text, or survey responses input actively by the Participant.</p>

<p>[NOTE:&nbsp; I have bracketed the word &ldquo;owned&rdquo; in the prior paragraph as a placeholder for the discussion of the Data User structure.&nbsp; Ownership of a Data User entity could, conceivably be in the form of some scalable &ldquo;co-op&rdquo; type structure.&nbsp; Consideration should also be given to new forms of benefit corporation, because they are based on the very familiar corporate model, with the distinction of enabling the identification of a benefitted group of parties the needs of which officers and directors of the benefit corporation must take into account for all decisions.&nbsp; Perhaps the Data Users (multiple) should be encouraged to be formed together as a benefit corporation, with the various Data Rights Owners named as the benefitted group.&nbsp; The benefit corporation might provide a nice organizational &ldquo;container&rdquo; for the relationships anticipated in the Data User setting.&nbsp; That potential structuring solution should be researched further]</p>

<p>[cliii] Definition Under Review: [NOTE:&nbsp; To be discussed.&nbsp; Definition not yet edited.&nbsp; We need to discuss the distinction between party and participant, and to clarify the terms.&nbsp; Is a party someone who signs the agreement and a participant a Party that is also enrolled and registered?&nbsp; Is there a reason to distinguish these two statuses?]</p>

<p><strong>Original:&nbsp; Participant</strong>: An individual or organization registered with and enrolled in a given Trust Framework. Enrollment includes review and acceptance of a Participation Agreement. Participants may engage in role relationships among each other. A Participant is a kind of Entity.</p>

<p>Proposed: <strong>Participant&rdquo; </strong>shall mean an individual or organization bound to the terms of this Agreement registered with and enrolled in a given Trust Framework.

<p>[clv] <strong>Definition Under Review:&nbsp; Original:&nbsp; Permissions</strong>: The permissions logic is driven by data mappings, Scope to allowed Purpose, and Purpose to accepted Role Relationship. The sharing level set by the participant establishes which purposes are active, through a sharing level to Purpose data mapping.</p>

<p>Proposed: &ldquo;<strong>Permissions&rdquo; </strong>means the established set of data access authorizations that are carried into effect by reference to Purpose specifications associated with specified Role Relationships.&nbsp; The correlation of different Roles with different Purposes and corresponding Scopes of use is &ldquo;mapped&rdquo; in the system technology and rules in a manner that permits Data Rights Owner control of Vault Data Sharing through the setting of Permissions.</p>

<div id="edn">
<p><a href="#_ednref" name="_edn156" title="">[clvi]</a> <strong>Definition Under Review:&nbsp; Original:&nbsp; Personal</strong> <strong>Data</strong> <strong>User</strong>: A protected Resource owned and controlled by a Participant to hold the Participant&rsquo;s personal data. The Participant controls access to use, modification, copying, derivative works, and redaction or deletion of the data they enter into the Trust Framework Personal Data User, including, without limitation, data entered based upon sensor data passively collected from the Participant&rsquo;s smartphone, and also including, without limitation, audio, text, or survey responses input actively by the Participant.</p>

<p>Proposed: &ldquo;<strong>Personal</strong> <strong>Data</strong> <strong>User&rdquo; or &ldquo;Data User&rdquo; </strong>means a hybrid system of business, legal and technical subsystems that together enable the provision of Services under this Agreement, and the legal entity that is responsible for organizing and operating such hybrid system.&nbsp; The Data User provides services to Data Rights Owners with respect to Vault Data, and acts on its own behalf with respect to Circulating Data.&nbsp; The Services associated with Vault Data are in the nature of [agency][fiduciary] services rendered with respect to a protected Resource [owned and] controlled by a Data Rights Owner and designed, developed and deployed to reliably collect, hold, process and dispose of the Data Rights Owner&rsquo;s Vault Data. The Data Rights Owner controls access to use, modification, copying, derivative works, and redaction or deletion of the Vault Data they enter or make available to the Trust Framework Personal Data User, including, without limitation, Vault Data&nbsp; entered based upon sensor data passively collected from the Participant&rsquo;s smartphone, and also including, without limitation, audio, text, or survey responses input actively by the Participant.[NOTE:&nbsp; I have bracketed the word &ldquo;owned&rdquo; in the prior paragraph as a placeholder for the discussion of the Data User structure.&nbsp; Ownership of a Data User could, conceivably be in the form of some scalable &ldquo;co-op&rdquo; type structure.&nbsp; Consideration should also be given to new forms of benefit corporation, because they are based on the very familiar corporate model, with the distinction of enabling the identification of a benefitted group of parties the needs of which officers and directors of the benefit corporation must take into account for all decisions.&nbsp; Perhaps the Data Users (multiple) should be encouraged to be formed as a benefit corporation, with the various Data Rights Owners named as the benefitted group.&nbsp; The benefit corporation might provide a nice organizational &ldquo;container&rdquo; for the relationships anticipated in the Data User setting.&nbsp; That potential structuring solution should be researched further].</p>

<p>[clvii] <strong>Definition Under Review:&nbsp; Original:&nbsp; Policy Authority</strong>: The Party that is responsible for promulgating the System Rules, and for governance of a Trust Framework. The Policy Authority designates the Party that conducts the role of System Operator.</p>

<p>Proposed: &ldquo;<strong>Policy Authority&rdquo; </strong>means the Party that is responsible for promulgating the System Rules, including this Agreement, and for governance of a Trust Framework that operates based on those rules. The Policy Authority also designates the Party that conducts the role of System Operator for a given instance of the Data User.</p>

</div>

<div id="edn">
<p><a href="#_ednref" name="_edn158" title="">[clviii]</a> Definition Under Review:&nbsp; <strong>Original:&nbsp; Principal User</strong>: A type of Participant who shares, by their permission, personal data (Personally Identifiable Information) for transmission to, storage in, quantification by and sharing through the Reality System. The Principal User transmits Personally Identifiable Information, including behavioral, location and other data to the Reality System through web-based systems and a mobile device that has been linked to that Principal User during their Enrollment and Registration, or subsequently. It is axiomatic that the Principal User owns and controls the use and sharing of their Personally Identifiable Information existing or that has existed in the Reality System.</p>

<p>Proposed: &ldquo;<strong>Data Rights Owner</strong>&rdquo; means a Party acting in the role of a Service recipient who has the right to determine whether and to what extent it will share, by the granting of Permissions, Vault Data including Vault Data intended for transmission to, storage in, quantification by and sharing through the Reality System. Through use of the Services, the Data Rights Owner can effect the transmission of or permit access to Vault Data , including behavioral, location and other data to third parties and to the Reality System through web-based systems and mobile devices that have been linked to that Data Rights Owner during their Enrollment and Registration, or subsequently. The Data Rights Owner owns and controls the rights associated with the use and sharing of Vault Data held by the Data User and in the Reality System.</p>

<div id="edn">
<p>[clix] In technical terms PII is a set of data that has low entropy vis a vis a participant.&nbsp; The manner in which data is brought together with other data dictates its status at any particular time as PII.&nbsp; Consider the effect of &ldquo;context&rdquo; by the example of a social security number.&nbsp; In the US, the number is very low entropy (it is intended to bear a 1:1 relationship to a particular individual, but the same number when considered in the context of another country&rsquo;s identity systems is merely a string of numbers, without providing any identity information.</p>

<p>[clx] Problem &nbsp;</p>

<p>Original: &quot;Problem&quot; shall mean any problem or circumstance that results from any of the following:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; (a)&nbsp; a perceived failure by either Party to perform its obligation under this Agreement;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; a perceived inadequacy or delay of either Party&#39;s performance under this Agreement; or</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; (c)&nbsp; a request for products, services, or resources where the Parties disagree as to whether such products, services, or resources are within the scope of this Agreement.</p>

<p><strong>Original:&nbsp; Role Relationship</strong>: A link between two Entities, with one Entity as the center, and the other Entity as the actor of the stated role.</p>

<p>Proposed:<strong> &ldquo;Role Relationship&rdquo; </strong>means a link of expected future behaviors between two Entities that arises as a result of their assumption of a given role, that establishes rights and obligations of the respective Entities, typically expressed as being composed of one Entity as the beneficiary of a set of rights relevant to a particular role, and the other Entity as the obligor of duties the performance of which gives rise to the other Entity&rsquo;s Rights.</p>

<p>[clxviii] Definition Under Review:&nbsp; [NOTE:&nbsp; Consider whether this technical concept is adequately covered by reference to the Data User generally from a legal perspective.&nbsp; Is the term &ldquo;Resource&rdquo; intended to describe the data or the User that houses it, or both?&nbsp; The current Agreement treats the value proposition as being in both, i.e., the Vault Data has intrinsic value for its ability to identify people in correlation with other data, and for its potential, untapped use in the derivation of Circulating Data and the Data User itself has value, in its ability to enable the &ldquo;data leverage&rdquo; and the extraction of that intrinsic value.&nbsp; Which meaning of &ldquo;resource&rdquo; is intended here?&nbsp; It may be useful to unpack the concept to help identify segregable value propositions that may depend upon varying system architectures (for example what is suggested for the management of Vault Data versus Circulating Data under the existing agreement.]</p>

<p><strong>Original:&nbsp; Resource</strong>: Protected data User, holding data in any form, but most commonly as a Personal Data User holding a Participant&rsquo;s personal data. A Resource Server provides the REST interface and Trust Wrapper access management services to the Resource.</p>

<p>Proposed:<strong> Resource</strong>: Sets of data, as well as the enhanced value in such data that is enabled by the realization of data leverage through the exercise of rights and the performance of obligations under this Agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp; Resource includes Vault Data, Shared Vault Data and Circulating Data as managed with the Services.</p>

<p>[clxix] Definition Under Review:&nbsp; Original (section 1): A Role relationship is a link between two Entities, interpreted as subject-predicate-object expressions, and similar to RDF (Resource Description Framework) triples used in Semantic Web data models.</p>

<p>Original (section 2):&nbsp; All role relationships must be explicitly stated.</p>

<p>Original (section3):&nbsp; A Participant may enable sharing of his or her data with other Participants via the setting of Role Relationships. For example, a Participant may have &ldquo;Child&rdquo; relationships with his or her children. The parent Participant is the subject, &ldquo;Child&rdquo; is the predicate, and the child Participant is the object. The children, in turn, could establish a &ldquo;Parent&rdquo; relationship with the parent.</p>

<p>Original (section 4):&nbsp; A System Role is a Role Relationship between a Participant and a System Entity, established by the system at Participant registration, enrollment, or first use of an application.</p>

<p>Proposed (section 1):&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Role Relationship&rdquo; means a context-related behavioral expectation link between two Entities.&nbsp; The Role Relationship description typically has three basic parts, interpreted as subject-predicate-object expressions that are similar to RDF (Resource Description Framework) triples used in Semantic Web data models.</p>

<p>Proposed (section 2): All Role Relationships that are supported by the Trust Framework represent &ldquo;default states&rdquo; that are documented in the terms of the Agreement that establish and affect specific rights and obligations of Entities with respect to User Vault Data, Shared Vault Data, and Circulating Data.</p>

<p>Proposed (section 3):&nbsp; A Data Rights Owner may enable sharing of Vault Data (thus giving rise to Shared Vault Data) with other Parties via the resetting of Role Relationships as enabled by the Services. For example, a Data Rights Owner may have &ldquo;Child&rdquo; relationships with his or her children. The parent Data Rights Owner is the subject, &ldquo;Child&rdquo; is the predicate, and the child Party [NOTE:&nbsp; Check on intended use of term Participant ?] is the object. The children, in turn, could establish a &ldquo;Parent&rdquo; relationship with the parent.&nbsp; [NOTE: In order to promote conformity to applicable child protection laws, the registration process should require that the role relationship default settings be established for Children under a certain age (13? 18?) with Parental participation and consent).]</p>

<p>Proposed (section 4):&nbsp; [NOTE:&nbsp; A System Role is a Role Relationship between a Participant and a System Entity, established by the system at the time of Participant registration, enrollment, or first use of an application.</p>

<p>[clxxvii] NOTE:&nbsp; Move this note to elsewhere in the draft][NOTE:&nbsp; Include definition of personal data as data that is or can be used to create PI.&nbsp; Query whether that means that all data is potentially &ldquo;personal data.&rdquo;&nbsp; Data can be combined and used (observed) to create information.&nbsp; So called &ldquo;personal data&rdquo; does not describe a quality inherent in the data itself, but rather the possibility that such data could be brought together with other data, and used (observed) by a party to infer an identity of a person.&nbsp; If that person is the Data Rights Owner, and if the data that can be personal data is held in the Data User, then such data may be considered to be &ldquo;personal data&rdquo; for purposes of this Agreement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note, it is anticipated that the Data User can transfer de-identified data (that is personal data, but is not then included in PI, since it is de-identified and would require other data or other context to be &ldquo;re-identified&rdquo; into PI) to third parties for its own account.&nbsp; That data is called &ldquo;Circulating Data&rdquo; in this Agreement.&nbsp; Is that allowed in EU and US Data Protection statutes (such as GLB, HIPAA, etc.)?&nbsp; If so, consider allowing such transfers on the Data Users account, much like banks can go generate revenue from the use of funds that they hold for depositors, or like brokers can trade for their own account.&nbsp; Where data is de-identified, that use of data poses no direct harm to Data Rights Owners, and the &ldquo;data leverage&rdquo; that it enables will help fund the building of systems that can better serve Data Rights Owners&rsquo; needs.&nbsp; That is allowed with respect to &ldquo;Circulating Data&rdquo; since it is de-identified and therefore no longer justifiably controlled by a particular Data Rights Owner.&nbsp; The alternative service is provided with respect to Vault Data, where the Agreement prohibits Data User from trading on their own account in held Vault data, causing their Services to be more in the nature of fiduciary services (where all trading is on the account of the party receiving the services).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Different Data Users might want to offer one or the other levels of Service.&nbsp; In the case where no trading is allowed independently by the Data User on identified data (the fiduciary model), the Data User will need to identify and exploit alternative models for financing, such as the generation of commissions associated with helping to appropriately place Shared Vault Data.</p>
