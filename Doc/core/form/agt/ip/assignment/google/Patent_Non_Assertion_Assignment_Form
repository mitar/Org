Agt.Title=<u>Open Patent Non-Assertion Pledge</u>
Preamble={P1.-} is committed to promoting innovation to further the overall growth and advancement of information technology and believes that {FOSS} is a very important tool for fostering innovation. {P1.-} is therefore pledging the free use of certain of its patents in connection with {FOSS} on the following terms:
Def.Sec=<u>Definitions</u><ol><li>{Def.FOSS}</li><li>{Def.Pledged_Patents}&nbsp;</li><li>{Def.Pledge}</li></ol>
Def.FOSS=&ldquo;{FOSS}&rdquo; means any software that is licensed or otherwise distributed to the public in such a way that satisfies any version of &ldquo;The Open Source Definition&rdquo; provided by the Open Source Initiative at <a href="http://opensource.org/osd">opensource.org/osd</a> or any version of &ldquo;The Free Software Definition&rdquo; provided by the Free Software Foundation at <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html</a>.
FOSS=Free or Open Source Software
Def.Pledged_Patents=&ldquo;Pledged Patents&rdquo; means the specific patents listed by {P1.-} at the following URL designated for purposes of this Pledge: <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/opnpledge/patents/">www.google.com/patents/opnpledge/patents/</a>. {P1.-} may supplement this list of patents from time to time in its discretion.
Def.Pledge=&ldquo;Pledge&rdquo; means the promise set forth in the first two paragraphs under &ldquo;Our Pledge.&rdquo;
Pledge.Sec=<u>Our Pledge</u><ol><li>{Pledge.NoSuit.sec}</li><li>{Pledge.Bind.sec}</li><li>{Pledge.Limit.sec}</li></ol>
Pledge.NoSuit.sec={Pledge.NoSuit.Include.Sen} {Pledge.NoSuit.Exclude.Sen}
Pledge.NoSuit.Include.Sen={Pledge.NoSuit.Include.Intro.Cl} (i) {Pledge.NoSuit.Include.FOSS.cl} or (ii) {Pledge.NoSuit.Include.Internal.cl}.
Pledge.NoSuit.Include.Intro.Cl={P1.-} promises to each person or entity that develops, distributes or uses Free or Open Source Software (a &ldquo;Pledge Recipient&rdquo;) that {P1.-} will not bring a lawsuit or other legal proceeding against a Pledge Recipient for patent infringement under any Pledged Patents based on the Pledge Recipient&rsquo;s
Pledge.NoSuit.Include.FOSS.cl={Patent.License.Grant.Use.cl} of any {FOSS}
Pledge.NoSuit.Include.Internal.cl=internal-only use of {FOSS}, either as obtained by Pledge Recipient or as modified by Pledge Recipient, in standalone form or combined with hardware or with any other software (&ldquo;Internal-Only Use&rdquo;)
Pledge.NoSuit.Exclude.Sen=The preceding Pledge does not apply to any infringement of the Pledged Patents by hardware or by software that is not {FOSS}, or by {FOSS} combined with special purpose hardware or with software that is not {FOSS} (except Internal-Only Use).
Pledge.Bind.sec=It is {P1.-}&rsquo;s intent that the Pledge be legally binding, irrevocable (except as otherwise provided under &ldquo;Defensive Termination&rdquo; below) and enforceable against {P1.andAmbit}, and their successors and assigns. Thus, {P1.-} will require any person or entity to whom it sells or transfers any of the Pledged Patents to agree, in writing, to abide by the Pledge and to place a similar requirement on any subsequent transferees to do the same.
Pledge.Limit.sec=The Pledge is not an assurance that any of the Pledged Patents cover any particular software or hardware or are enforceable, that the Pledged Patents are all patents that do or may cover any particular {FOSS}, that any activities covered by the Pledge will not infringe patents or other intellectual property rights of a third party, or that {P1.-} will add any other patents to the list of Pledged Patents. Except as expressly stated in the Pledge, no other rights are waived or granted by {P1.-} or received by a Pledge Recipient, whether by implication, estoppel, or otherwise.
DStop.Sec=<u>Defensive Termination</u><ol><li>{DStop.sec}&nbsp;</li><li>{DStop.Effect.sec}</li></ol>
DStop.sec={DStop.Rationale.Sen}&nbsp; {DStop.Right.Sen}
DStop.Rationale.Sen=Because our Pledge is a promise not to assert certain {P1.-} patents without requiring any payment from a Pledge Recipient, we think it is only fair that we condition the Pledge upon the Pledge Recipient (and its affiliates) not asserting or profiting from the assertion of patents against {P1.-}, its affiliates, or its products or services.
<strong>DStop Dissection=here</strong>
DStop.Right.Sen=Accordingly, {P1.-} reserves the right to {DStop.Terminate} with respect to any {DStop.Aggressor}.
DStop.Terminate=terminate the Pledge, to the extent {P1.-} deems necessary to protect {P1.Interests} (&ldquo;Defensive Termination&rdquo;)
P1.Interests=itself, its affiliates, or its products and services
DStop.Aggressor.Note=Does &quot;UsingProduct&quot; modify only 3PartyUser or also P1.orAmbit?&nbsp; Because of repetition of &quot;against,&quot; seems to modify only 3PartyUser.&nbsp; This seems the desired result, but could be made clearer.
DStop.Aggressor={Pledgee.orAmbit}&nbsp;who {FilesPatentSuit} or {BenefitsFromSuchSuit} (an &quot;Asserting Party&quot;) against {P1.orAmbit} or against any {3PartyUser}
Pledgee.orAmbit=Pledge Recipient (or affiliate)
FilesPatentSuit=files a lawsuit or other legal proceeding for patent infringement
BenefitsFromSuchSuit=has a direct financial interest in such lawsuit or other legal proceeding
3PartyUser=third party {UsingProduct}
UsingProduct=based in whole or in part on any product or service developed by or on behalf of {P1.orAmbit}
DStop.Effect.sec=Any Defensive Termination by {P1.-} with respect to an Asserting Party shall have the same effect as if Our Pledge was never extended to such Asserting Party in the first instance. {P1.-}, in its sole discretion, shall determine the manner and terms, if any, by which rights under Pledged Patents may be extended to an Asserting Party after that Asserting Party&rsquo;s lawsuit or other legal proceeding is permanently dismissed, terminated or withdrawn in writing.
MistakenAssertion.Sec=<u>Mistaken Assertion</u><ul><li>{MistakenAssertion.sec}</li></ul>
MistakenAssertion.sec=Should {P1.-} ever initiate a lawsuit or other legal proceeding for patent infringement based on software which is not the subject of a Defensive Termination, and then receive written notice from the party against whom such lawsuit or other legal proceeding has been filed providing sufficient information for {P1.-} to reasonably determine that such software in fact satisfies the requirements of the Pledge, then {P1.-} will use reasonable efforts to withdraw such lawsuit (or the applicable claims therein) or move to terminate such other legal proceeding (or the applicable portions thereof) within sixty (60) days after receiving such written notice.</li>
