If one or more of the provisions in {this Agreement} are deemed void or unenforceable to any extent in any context, such provisions shall nevertheless be enforced to the fullest extent allowed by law in that and other contexts, and the validity and force of the remainder of {this Agreement} shall not be affected. {The Company} and {P2.I/C} have attempted to limit {P2.my/C} right to use, maintain and disclose {the Company's Confidential Information}, and to limit {P2.my/C} right to solicit employees and customers only to the extent necessary to protect {the Company} from unfair competition. Should a court of competent jurisdiction determine that the scope of the covenants contained in Section {Unfair.Xnum} exceeds the maximum restrictiveness such court deems reasonable and enforceable, the {parties} intend that the court should reform, modify{q} and enforce the provision to such narrower scope as it determines to be reasonable and enforceable under the circumstances existing at that time.

Misc.Sever.ConsultRecharacterizedAsEmployee._Sen=In the event that any court or government agency of competent jurisdiction determines that, notwithstanding the terms of {the Consulting Agreement} specifying {Consultant}'s {Relationship} with {the Company} as that of an independent contractor, {Consultant}'s provision of services to {the Company} is not as an independent contractor but instead as an employee under the applicable laws, then solely to the extent that such determination is applicable, references in {this Agreement} to {the Relationship} between {Consultant} and {the Company} shall be interpreted to include an employment relationship, and {this Agreement} shall not be invalid and unenforceable but shall be read to the fullest extent as may be valid and enforceable under the applicable laws to carry out the intent and purpose of {the Agreement}.
