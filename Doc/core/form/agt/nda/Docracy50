Proprietary Information shall not include any information that: {Conf.Except.List} Discloser represents and warrants to Recipient that it is authorized to disclose any and all Proprietary Information made available to Recipient under this Agreement.

Each party shall be responsible for any breach of its confidentiality obligations by its respective employees and agents.

3=<b>Compelled Disclosures.</b>  These restrictions will not prevent either party from complying with any law, regulation, court order or other legal requirement that purports to compel disclosure of any Proprietary Information. Recipient will promptly notify Discloser upon learning of any such legal requirement, and cooperate with Discloser in the exercise of its right to protect the confidentiality of the Proprietary Information before any tribunal or governmental agency.

4=<b>No Warranties or Licenses.</b>  All Proprietary Information is provided “AS IS.” Discloser will not be liable to Recipient for damages arising from any use of the Proprietary Information, from errors, omissions or otherwise. All of Discloser’s rights in and to its Proprietary Information remain the exclusive property of Discloser. Neither this Agreement, nor any disclosure of Proprietary Information hereunder: {Limit.List}

Remedy.Return=Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, or upon Discloser’s request at any time, Recipient shall promptly return to Discloser all originals and copies of any Proprietary Information and destroy all information, records and materials developed therefrom.

6=<b>Remedies.</b>  Due to the unique nature of the Proprietary Information, the parties agree that any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement will cause not only financial harm to Discloser, but also irreparable harm for which money damages will not be an adequate remedy.
