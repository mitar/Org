NOTHING TO SEE, SO FAR.  <br>This is intended for a tree of legal requirements for transfer of personal information.  Beginning perhaps with medical info use case.  The idea is to populate lists with key=values that correspond to specific requirements.  The lists will be organized based on jurisdiction and law, using multiple inheritance.  So, a developer or other person trying to figure out if a transfer is permitted will situate themselves in this graph in such a way that the appropriate jurisdictions are in their namespace, and therefore the set of requirements are the collection of keys in that namespace.  

Inheritance enables us to express complex sets of thoughts in an organized format.

We can use this framework to help developers write applications that respect the rules.  We can also populate it with suggested legal text for defining the relationships.
