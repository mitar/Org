Title=Movement of Persons with Possible Exposure to Ebola

Intro=Due to the current possible exposure of healthcare workers (HCWs) to Ebola and the need to closely monitor those HCWs, the following measures should be communicated to the HCWs by the public health personnel who are monitoring the HCWs and these measures are to be taken

Measure.BannedTravel=No individual who entered {the first Ebola patient's} room can travel by commercial transportation until 21 days after that individual's last exposure.  These individuals should not travel by commercial conveyances (e.g., airplane, ship, long-distance bus, or train).  Local use of public transportation (e.g. taxi, bus) by asymptomatic individuals should be discussed with the public health authority.

Measure.HealthMonitoring=All HCW involved in the direct care of {the first Ebola patient} must be monitored twice a day with one of the monitoring sessions being a face to face encounter.  As part of that monitoring, each HCW's temperature will be checked twice a day;

Measure.BannedPlaces=No individual HCW who entered {the first Ebola patient's} room can go to any location where members of the public congregate which includes but is not limited to, restaurants, grocery stores, theaters, or other places where the public may be in attendance or gather, throughout the entire 21 day time period that follows the individual's last exposure.

Measure.Shelter=All HCWs who provide direct care in {the first Ebola patient's} room will be given the opportunity to stay at {Presbyterian Hospital} on a non-admission status in order to facilitate monitoring; and 

Measure.Enforcement=Any HCW that does not adhere to monitoring or any of these other measures may be subject to a communicable disease control order.
