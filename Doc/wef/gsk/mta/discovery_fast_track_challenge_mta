2.Title=Terms of Use; Reporting of Results.

2.1.Sec=Provision of Material to GSK. Institution agrees to provide the Material to GSK in  the quantity set forth in the Research Plan. In the event that additional quantities of Material  may be needed by GSK in order to complete the Research, GSK will notify the Institution in  writing and the Parties will discuss in good faith whether additional Material may be made  available to GSK; provided, that, if Institution is in possession of additional amounts of such  requested Material, Institution will use its best efforts to provide the requested amounts of such  Material to GSK. All Material provided to GSK under this Agreement shall be accompanied by a  Material Transfer Record (“MTR”) in the form attached as Schedule 2, which will be signed by  Institution when sent, and signed by GSK upon receipt of such Material.

2.2.Intro=Restrictions on use of Material. GSK agrees that the Material:

2.2.(a)=is to be used solely for the Research in accordance with the Research Plan  during the term of the Agreement as described herein;

2.2.(b)=is to be used in compliance with all applicable statutes and regulations;

2.2.(c)=will not be used in human subjects, in clinical trials, or for diagnostic purposes  involving human subjects without the written consent of Institution;

2.2.(d)=is to be used only under the direction of employees, agents or consultants of  GSK or its Affiliates; and

2.2.(e)=will not be provided to any third party by GSK without the prior written consent of  Institution, except that GSK may provide the Material to its employees, agents, consultants and  Affiliates, provided that such employees, agents, consultants and Affiliates are obligated  (whether in a written agreement or otherwise) to comply with the terms and conditions of this  Agreement.

2.3.Sec=Provision of Confirmed Hits to Institution or Institution’s Investigator; Institution Results. The Parties recognize that the Institution may have unique systems, assays or models  that may be useful or necessary to further confirm or validate the Confirmed Hits obtained by  GSK during its conduct of the Research. Depending on the specific GSK Results (as defined  below) obtained by GSK during the conduct of such Research activities, if the Parties determine  that it would be advantageous for GSK to transfer to the Institution or the Institution’s  Investigator such Confirmed Hits for the purpose of allowing the Institution or Institution’s  Investigator to conduct any such further testing of such Confirmed Hits in the Institution’s  biological systems or assays, the Parties will negotiate and execute a "GSK Transfer Contract"  a form template of which is attached hereto as Schedule 3. The GSK Transfer Contract will  include an attached work plan setting forth the specific activities to be conducted by the  Institution and/or Institution’s Investigator with the Confirmed Hits, including a timeline for the  conduct of such activities, said timeline shall not extend beyond the term of this agreement.

2.4.Sec=<b>{P1.Handle} Results.</b> Within the later of: (a) sixty (60) days following the conclusion of  the Research by GSK, or, (b) in the event that the Parties have entered into a GSK Transfer  Contract pursuant to Section 2.3 above, then within forty-five (45) days following receipt by GSK of the results of the testing conducted by Institution or the Institution's Investigator under the GSK Transfer Contract (the "Institution Results"), GSK shall provide Institution with a summary of the results of the Research relating to the Material that were generated solely by  GSK in the conduct of the Research activities allocated to GSK under this Agreement (the “GSK  Results”). The GSK Results shall be considered GSK Confidential Information and shall be  kept confidential by the Institution. Because the GSK Results includes information on the GSK  proprietary compounds that were identified by GSK during the conduct of the Research,  Institution shall not publish or otherwise disclose the GSK Results to any third party or use the  GSK Results except for the Institution’s own internal research purposes (excluding any such  internal research conducted with, for, or on behalf of a third party commercial entity in the event  of Research Outcome 2, Section 3.2, below) without first obtaining GSK’s prior written consent  to such disclosure or use. Nothing set forth in this Section 2.4 shall prevent Institution from  exercising the Institution’s publication rights as specifically set forth in Section 5.4 below,  provided that such publications do not contain the GSK Results.

2.5.Sec=<b>Acknowledgement of Prior Activities.</b> Institution understands and acknowledges  that prior to the Effective Date, GSK and/or its Affiliates may have performed or engaged in, or  otherwise arranged for the conducting of, research, development and commercialization  activities relating to performing a molecular discovery campaign and/or conducting activities or  otherwise evaluating biological materials which may include the Materials. Further, Institution acknowledges and agrees that nothing contained in this Agreement will be construed, by  implication or otherwise, as prohibiting GSK and/or its Affiliates, during the Term and thereafter,  from performing or engaging in, or otherwise arranging for the conducting of, research,  development or commercialization activities relating in whole or in part to molecular discovery  campaigns, independent and without the use of Materials or Confidential Information.

3.Title=Outcome of Research; Further Actions.

3.Intro=The Parties acknowledge and agree that one (1) of the four (4) following options (each a  "Research Outcome") will result from the conduct of the Research pursuant to this Agreement.  For Research Outcomes 1, 2 or 3, the Parties will negotiate and enter into a separate  agreement as further specified below that will govern any further use, publication rights,  ownership, and development of Confirmed Hits identified in the conduct of the Research under  this Agreement.

3.1.Sec=<b>Research Outcome 1 - GSK and Institution Mutually Agree to Continue and  Expand the Research.</b> If, based on each Party’s review of the GSK Results, and/or the  Institution Results, if applicable, the Parties mutually agree that it would be advantageous to  further evaluate the Materials and/or the Confirmed Hits resulting from the use of the Materials  in the Research, then:

3.1.(a)=The Parties will, in good faith, negotiate a DPAc Agreement to govern the  conduct of additional research, development, and potential commercialization by GSK of  the Materials and/or Confirmed Hits resulting from the use of the Materials in the  Research; such DPAc Agreement to include the principle financial terms as set forth on  the attached Schedule 4, attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

3.1.(b)=If the Parties enter into a DPAc Agreement, all data and results obtained under  the Research pursuant to this Agreement, including results obtained from the conduct of  activities by Institution pursuant to Section 2.3 herein, will, unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties, be used in connection with activities under such DPAc  Agreement, and further work related thereto will be carried out and governed by the  terms set forth in the DPAc Agreement. In the event of a conflict between terms in this  Agreement and any future DPAc Agreement negotiated pursuant to the Research  performed under this Agreement, the terms of the DPAc Agreement control.

3.1.(c)=If the Parties are unable to reach agreement on the terms of a DPAc Agreement  within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed one hundred and eighty (180) days  from the date they begin negotiating, then GSK may elect to proceed under the terms of  Section 3.3, Research Outcome 3, herein.

3.2.Sec=<b>Research Outcome 2 - Institution Desires to Continue the Research, but GSK  determines that GSK Results and/or Institution Results are not of sufficient interest to enter into  a DPAc Agreement.</b> In the event that, based on the GSK Results and/or Institution Results, as  applicable, the Institution desires to continue the Research but GSK does not, then:

3.2.(a)=GSK will either, at GSK’s sole discretion, (i) provide to the Institution, or (ii) jointly  publish with Institution, the structures for one (1) to three (3) compounds from the Research that  GSK has determined (iii) are not included in or related to an internal GSK research program,  and (iv) are not encumbered by any external third party obligations or restrictions on GSK (such  compounds the “Presented Compounds”). Institution may use the Presented Compounds for  any and all purposes, and may create derivatives, analogs, or modified versions of the  Presented Compounds. For the avoidance of doubt, GSK will not have an obligation to conduct,  and does not warrant that it has conducted, a freedom to operate analysis with respect to the  Presented Compounds.

3.2.(b)=Pursuant to this Section 3.2, GSK agrees to negotiate in good faith an agreement  with the Institution to allow the Institution to progress research and development efforts with  respect to the Presented Compounds, on its own, or with, or for the benefit of a third party, such  agreement to include the following minimum terms:

3.2.(b).(i)=The Institution will have the right to progress the research and development of  the Presented Compounds and to commercialize any such Presented Compounds, and  any derivatives, analogs, or modified versions of the Presented Compounds made by  the Institution, on fair and reasonable terms, which will include the terms set forth in the  attached Schedule 4;

3.2.(b).(ii)=GSK will retain a worldwide, fully paid-up, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable  right and license to make and use the Presented Compounds solely for research and  development (but not for commercial) purposes. For clarity, such research and  development purposes would allow Presented Compounds to remain in the GSK  compound library, to be used in other GSK screens, and to form the basis for medicinal chemistry research and development programs at GSK. Further, such license would be  sublicenseable to GSK's Affiliates and collaborators; and

3.2.(b).(iii)=Institution will have the right to seek intellectual property protection for the  Presented Compounds and any derivatives, analogs or modified versions thereof that  are made by the Institution.

3.3.Sec=<b>Research Outcome 3 - GSK Desires to Continue the Research and enter into a DPAc  Agreement, but the Institution does not elect to enter into a DPAc Agreement.</b> In the event that,  based on the GSK Results and/or the Institution Results, as applicable, GSK desires to continue  the Research and to enter into a DPAc Agreement with the Institution for reasonable funding of  further research and development activities, but the Institution elects not to proceed to negotiate  and enter into a DPAc Agreement, then:

3.3.(a)=GSK will have the right to continue with the Research and to progress any hits,  Confirmed Hits, or derivatives, analogs, or modified versions of the foregoing, identified during  the conduct of the Research under this Agreement to be treated in the same way as if such hits  or Confirmed Hits arose from a GSK internal research and development program;

3.3.(b)=Effective upon notice by Institution in writing that it will not elect to negotiate a  DPAc Agreement, to the extent legally able, Institution shall grant to GSK a non-exclusive,  royalty-free, worldwide, right and license, with a right to grant sublicenses to GSK Affiliates and collaborators, under Institution’s rights in any existing and/or arising intellectual property claiming the Material ;

3.3.(c)=GSK will not have an obligation to provide to the Institution or to publish any  structures of any of the Confirmed Hits from the Research; and

3.3.(d)=Within sixty (60) days following the grant in Section 3.3(b), GSK agrees to  negotiate an agreement with Institution which will set forth milestone payments payable to  Institution by GSK in consideration for the aforementioned license grant. For clarity, no royalties  will be owed.

3.4.Sec=<b>Research Outcome 4 - Neither Party Desires to Continue the Research.</b> In the  event that GSK determines that the Research has not generated any Confirmed Hits, or in the  event that based on the GSK Results and/or Institution Results neither Party desires to continue  the Research and expand the research relationship, then:

3.4.(a)=GSK will not have an obligation to provide to the Institution or to publish any  structures of any of the Confirmed Hits from the Research;

3.4.(b)=if the Research generated any Confirmed Hits, GSK will not, for a period of three  (3) years following the Effective Date of this Agreement, conduct any activities using any such  Confirmed Hits in connection with the specific target identified by Institution in the Materials,  unless GSK exercises its rights pursuant to Section 3.4(c) below;

3.4.(c)=if the Research generated any Confirmed Hits, GSK may, for a period of three (3)  years following the Effective Date of this Agreement, elect to continue the Research by  providing written notice to Institution and allowing Institution the option to enter into a DPAc  Agreement with GSK for such purpose. If within forty-five (45) days following receipt of such  notice from GSK Institution provides written notice to GSK of its election to negotiate and enter  into a DPAc Agreement, the terms of Section 3.1 above shall apply. If within forty-five (45) days  following receipt of such notice from GSK Institution does not elect in writing to GSK to  negotiate a DPAc Agreement for the purpose of continuing the Research, then GSK may elect  to unilaterally progress any Confirmed Hits identified in the Research in accordance with the  terms set forth in Section 3.3 above, and all of the terms set forth in Section 3.3 above would  apply.


4.Title=Intellectual Property

4.1.Sec=Pre-Existing Rights. Institution will retain ownership in its intellectual and  industrial property rights in the Material. GSK will retain ownership in its intellectual and  industrial property rights in any materials and compounds that are owned or controlled by GSK.

4.2.Sec=Material Arising Intellectual Property. Arising intellectual property that relatesdirectly to the Material will be owned by the Institution ("Material Inventions"). Institution shall,  and shall ensure that the Institution’s Investigator, as well as the Institution's employees, agents,  and consultants, shall, sign, execute, make, and do all such further deeds, documents, and acts  as reasonably required to give effect to the provisions of this Section 4.2. GSK shall, and shall  ensure that its employees, agents and consultants shall, sign, execute, make, and do all such  further deeds, documents, and acts as reasonably required to give effect to the provisions of  this Section 4.2.

4.3.Sec=GSK Arising Intellectual Property. GSK will own all rights in the GSK Results, and  in any information, data and results that GSK generates on any GSK compounds identified from  GSK’s proprietary compound library during the conduct of the Research under this Agreement and any GSK-generated derivates or analogs thereto. Subject to Section 4.2, GSK will own all  inventions and related intellectual property (including know-how, patents and copyrights), that  as between GSK and Institution, GSK discovers or makes during the course of the Research.

4.4.Sec=Other Inventions. Inventorship of all other arising intellectual property rights,  except as set forth in Section 4.2 and Section 4.3. above, will be determined by applicable  patent law, and ownership will follow inventorship.

4.5.Sec=No Further Rights. Except as provided in this Agreement, no express or implied  licenses or other rights are provided to GSK, to Institution, or to Institution’s Investigator under  any patents, patent applications, trade secrets or other proprietary rights of Institution or GSK,  as applicable.

5.Title=Confidentiality; Publication

5.1.Sec=The term “Confidential Information” means any and all confidential or proprietary  information clearly marked as “Confidential” disclosed by or on behalf of one Party (oral  information reduced to writing within 30 days), on or after the Effective Date, to the other Party  in connection with this Agreement. However, Confidential Information does not include any  portion of the Confidential Information which:

5.1.(a)=at the time of disclosure is in the public domain;

5.1.(b)=after disclosure becomes in the public domain, except through breach of this Agreement by the receiving Party;

5.1.(e)=was developed by or for the receiving Party independently of the disclosure of  Confidential Information by the disclosing Party or its Affiliates.

5.2.Sec=Protection of Confidential Information. For a period of five (5) years after the  Effective Date of the Agreement, the receiving Party shall keep the Confidential Information  strictly confidential and, except as otherwise permitted herein, shall not disclose such  Confidential Information to any third party without first obtaining the disclosing Party’s prior  written consent. The standard of care required of the receiving Party in protecting the  confidentiality of Confidential Information is the same standard of care that the receiving Party uses in protecting its own confidential information of a similar nature, but in no event shall the  receiving Party use less than a reasonable standard of care. The receiving Party may disclose  Confidential Information only to its Affiliates, employees or consultants on a need-to-know basis,  provided that the receiving Party will have executed or shall execute appropriate written  agreements with such Affiliates, and consultants sufficient to enable the receiving Party to  comply with all the provisions of this Agreement.

5.3.Sec=Permitted Disclosure. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, in the  event that the receiving Party hereafter becomes obligated by mandatory applicable law, regulatory rule or judicial or administrative order to disclose such Confidential Information or any portion thereof, to any governmental authority or court or other party to the extent required by  statute, the receiving Party shall immediately notify the disclosing Party of each such  requirement and identify the Confidential Information so required thereby, so that the disclosing  Party may seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy with respect to narrowing the  scope of such requirement and/or waive compliance by the receiving Party with the provisions  of this Agreement. If, in the absence of such protective order or other remedy, the receiving  Party is nonetheless required by mandatory applicable law to disclose any part of the  Confidential Information, the receiving Party may disclose such Confidential Information without  liability hereunder, provided, that, the receiving Party shall furnish only such portion of the  Confidential Information which is legally required to be disclosed and only to the extent required  by applicable law.

5.4.Sec=Publication Rights. Institution shall have the right to publish the results of any  research activities conducted by the Institution using the Materials or the Presented Compounds (i.e. those GSK compounds presented to Institution under Section 3.2 (“Research Scenario  #2”)), without the prior written consent of GSK. To the extent that the GSK Results are provided  to the Institution, publication of any such GSK Results by the Institution shall be governed by  Section 2.4 of this Agreement.
