Outcome.2.Agreement.2={P1.Handle} will retain a worldwide, fully paid-up, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable right and license to make and use the Presented Compounds solely for research and development (but not for commercial) purposes. For clarity, such research and development purposes would allow Presented Compounds to remain in the {P1.Handle} compound library, to be used in other {P1.Handle} screens, and to form the basis for medicinal chemistry research and development programs at {P1.Handle}. Further, such license would be sublicenseable to {P1.Handle}'s Affiliates and collaborators

Outcome.2.Agreement.3={P2.Handle} will have the right to seek intellectual property protection for the Presented Compounds and any derivatives, analogs or modified versions thereof that are made by {P2.Handle}

Outcome.3.Progress={P1.Handle} will have the right to continue with the {Research} and to progress any hits, {Confirmed Hits}, or derivatives, analogs, or modified versions of the foregoing, identified during the conduct of the {Research} under this Agreement to be treated in the same way as if such hits or {Confirmed Hits} arose from a {P1.Handle} internal research and development program;

Outcome.3.License=Effective upon notice by {P2.Handle} in writing that it will not elect to negotiate a {DPAc Agreement}, to the extent legally able, {P2.Handle} shall grant to {P1.Handle} a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, right and license, with a right to grant sublicenses to {P1.Handle} Affiliates and collaborators, under {P2.Handle}’s rights in any existing and/or arising intellectual property claiming the {Material};

Outcome.3.NotExpose={P1.Handle} will not have an obligation to provide to {P2.Handle} or to publish any structures of any of the {Confirmed Hits} from the {Research}; and

Outcome.3.Payments=Within sixty (60) days following the grant in Section {Outcome.3.License.Xnum}, {P1.Handle} agrees to negotiate an agreement with {P2.Handle} which will set forth milestone payments payable to {P2.Handle} by {P1.Handle} in consideration for the aforementioned license grant. For clarity, no royalties will be owed.

Outcome.4.Expose={P1.Handle} will not have an obligation to provide to {P2.Handle} or to publish any structures of any of the {Confirmed Hits} from the {Research};

Outcome.4.ProgressRefrain=if the {Research} generated any {Confirmed Hits}, {P1.Handle} will not, for a period of three (3) years following the Effective Date of this Agreement, conduct any activities using any such {Confirmed Hits} in connection with the specific target identified by {P2.Handle} in the {Material}s, unless {P1.Handle} exercises its rights pursuant to Section {Outcome.4.ProgressOption.Xnum} below;

Outcome.4.ProgressOption=if the {Research} generated any {Confirmed Hits}, {P1.Handle} may, for a period of three (3) years following the Effective Date of this Agreement, elect to continue the {Research} by providing written notice to {P2.Handle} and allowing {P2.Handle} the option to enter into a {DPAc Agreement} with {P1.Handle} for such purpose. If within forty-five (45) days following receipt of such notice from {P1.Handle} {P2.Handle} provides written notice to {P1.Handle} of its election to negotiate and enter into a {DPAc Agreement}, the terms of Section {Outcome.1.Xnum} above shall apply. If within forty-five (45) days following receipt of such notice from {P1.Handle} {P2.Handle} does not elect in writing to {P1.Handle} to negotiate a {DPAc Agreement} for the purpose of continuing the {Research}, then {P1.Handle} may elect to unilaterally progress any {Confirmed Hits} identified in the {Research} in accordance with the terms set forth in Section {Outcome.3.Xnum} above, and all of the terms set forth in Section {Outcome.3.Xnum} above would apply.
