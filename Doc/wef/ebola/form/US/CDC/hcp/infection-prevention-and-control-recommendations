/Redoing the structure as an outline (same content, but easier to manage). 

/Note=An experiment.  By making policy available in codified form - with rapid collaboration through modularity and versioning - might we be able to improve coordination?

Title=Infection Prevention and Control Recommendations for Hospitalized Patients with Known or Suspected Ebola Virus Disease in U.S. Hospitals

Table below=Outline below
/Note=making this up.  Trying to give structure.
Intro.Title=Background
Intro.GuideFor=Standard, contact, and droplet precautions are recommended for management of hospitalized patients with known or suspected Ebola virus disease (EVD) (See {Table below}). 

Intro.OtherGuides=Note that this guidance outlines only those measures that are specific for EVD; additional infection control measures might be warranted if an EVD patient has other conditions or illnesses for which other measures are indicated (e.g., tuberculosis, multi-drug resistant organisms, etc.).

Intro.GuideAppliesToAllHealthcare=Though these recommendations focus on the hospital setting, the recommendations for personal protective equipment (PPE) and environmental infection control measures are applicable to any healthcare setting. 

Intro.Def.HCP.Base=In this guidance healthcare personnel (HCP) refers all persons, paid and unpaid, working in healthcare settings who have the potential for exposure to patients and/or to infectious materials, including body substances, contaminated medical supplies and equipment, contaminated environmental surfaces, or aerosols generated during certain medical procedures.

Intro.Def.HCP.Include=HCP include, but are not limited to, physicians, nurses, nursing assistants, therapists, technicians, emergency medical service personnel, dental personnel, pharmacists, laboratory personnel, autopsy personnel, students and trainees, contractual personnel, home healthcare personnel, and persons not directly involved in patient care (e.g., clerical, dietary, house-keeping, laundry, security, maintenance, billing, chaplains, and volunteers) but potentially exposed to infectious agents that can be transmitted to and from HCP and patients. 

Intro.OnlyInHealthcare=This guidance is not intended to apply to persons outside of healthcare settings.

Intro.Updating=As information becomes available, these recommendations will be re-evaluated and updated as needed.

Intro.Reasons=These recommendations are based upon available information (as of July 30, 2014) and the following considerations: {Policy.Reason.List}

Policy.Reason.List=<ol><li>{Policy.Reason.Morbidity}</li><li>{Policy.Reason.Transmission}</li><li>{Policy.Reason.NoVaccine}</li></ol>

Policy.Reason.Morbidity=High rate of morbidity and mortality among infected patients

Policy.Reason.Transmission=Risk of human-to-human transmission

Policy.Reason.NoVaccine=Lack of FDA-approved vaccine and therapeutics

Injection.Comment=Any injection equipment or parenteral medication container that enters the patient treatment area should be dedicated to that patient and disposed of at the point of use.


Duration.Title=Duration of Infection Control Precautions

Duration.Guide=Duration of precautions should be determined on a case-by-case basis, in conjunction with local, state, and federal health authorities.

Duration.Comment=Factors that should be considered include, but are not limited to: presence of symptoms related to EVD, date symptoms resolved, other conditions that would require specific precautions (e.g., tuberculosis, <em>Clostridium difficile</em>) and available laboratory information
