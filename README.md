This is a repository of legal documents organized as source texts, and "Deal" docs that use them. 

To get going, you need to pull this repository and then launch a command line, go to your folder, then run the perl script.  

E.g.:

perl parser2.pl Doc/Test/Render_Me.txt > Doc/Test/Output.html

With your browser, view that output file:  {YourRoot}/Doc/Test/Output.html.  

This parser is totally rudimentary and has a few known bugs.  But it let's us write legal forms in their source format and start on the job of making a form book for everyone.
